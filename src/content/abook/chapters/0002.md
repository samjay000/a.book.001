## **Chapter 2 – The Trial of Transformation**



First thing Aran felt as consciousness commes its way back into his mind was pain.  
Not the raw agony from earlier—the searing inferno that had consumed his body in the pool—but a dull, bone-deep ache that throbbed with every heartbeat.  
He was lying on his side, half-curled on the cold stone floor, water dripping from his hair, his skin sticky with sweat and dried blood.

He blinked slowly. The air was warmer now, thicker. Each breath carried a faint metallic tang.  
His arms trembled as he pushed himself up to a sitting position. Every muscle protested, but he forced movement.  
He had survived. Somehow.

His eyes scanned the chamber—stone pillars with glowing runes, shallow pools scattered in the corners, and a ceiling webbed with flowing lines of ancient inscriptions. The entire room pulsed faintly with ambient energy, like the slow heartbeat of something sleeping… or watching.

He coughed, the sound echoing hollowly through the chamber. His voice felt raw. His body heavier, but also… denser.

Then came the voice.

> “Primary marrow refinement complete. Candidate stabilization confirmed.”

It echoed not in the air, but within his mind.

He flinched, his back hitting the stone behind him. “Who—what is that?”

> “Designation: Soul Artifact Interface. Bound to candidate upon activation of legacy node. Synchronization level: minimal. Core integration: pending.”

Aran blinked. “Soul… artifact?”

His heart pounded harder now, though not from fear. Something about the voice felt… embedded, like it had always been there, just silent until now.

He swallowed hard. “I wasn’t trying to activate anything. I was just—running.”

> “Acknowledged. Legacy formation was triggered by direct blood contact with outer node. Accidental activation confirmed.”

That gave him pause.

His injuries… while running away from village. The cuts from diving through the jungle.  
He must have bled on something—something buried outside the ruin.

An accident. Just a drop of blood. And now… this?

He glanced down at his body. The torn clothes still clung to him, though they looked drier now, cleaner even. His arms looked stronger, more defined. There was a firmness in his skin, a sense of tension, like power waiting to be used.

> “Candidate has survived preliminary inheritance sequence. Status: eligible to continue. Mortal Awakening Realm—Stage One initiated.”

The words hung in the air like a hammer blow.

“Stage One…?”

A soft chiming sound filled his ears. A translucent panel shimmered into existence in front of him, faint and flickering like heat-haze. It listed information he didn’t fully understand, yet instinctively grasped:

---

**Name:** Aran  
**Realm:** Mortal Awakening  
**Stage:** 1  
**Affinity:** Undetermined  
**Marrow Purification:** 100%  
**Qi Circulation:** Initiated – Lower Dantian Node active  
**Body Status:** Stable  
**Meridians Unlocked:** 1 (Central Line)

---

He reached out instinctively, and the panel responded to his thoughts—vanishing with a blink.

He sat in silence for a long moment. No glowing sword. No immortal spirit guide. Just a cold chamber and a voice inside his head.

Still, he wasn’t dead. And something had changed. He could feel it, deep inside.

The voice returned, calm and emotionless.

> “Progression must continue. Physical stability is temporary without secondary integration.”

Aran frowned. “What does that mean?”

> “Your body has been reforged. Without full stabilization, core collapse is likely within 72 hours. Proceed to next phase.”

“What next phase?”

One of the rune-marked pillars flared to life, its runes pulsing in sequence. A new light bloomed at the far end of the chamber—dim at first, then sharpening into focus.

It was a **tree**, small and twisted, growing impossibly from a crack in the stone. At its branches, fruits glowed with internal light—each orb pulsing like a heartbeat. One of them, lower than the rest, shimmered gold, brighter than the others.

> “Consume a Spirit Fruit. It will initiate full core formation and complete your Mortal Awakening foundation.”

Aran hesitated. “You mean… eat that?”

> “Correct. Selection will determine the structure of your energy affinity. Choose wisely.”

He didn’t feel wise.

He felt tired. Raw. Out of place.

But there was no going back.

He staggered to his feet, each step uncertain but growing steadier. His legs still ached, but his footing was sure.

As he approached the tree, the golden fruit pulsed in time with his heartbeat.

He reached out.

His hand hovered for a moment.

And then he grasped it.

The warmth in the fruit was immediate—radiating through his palm, down his arm, into his chest.  
It was alive. Or something close to it.

He brought it to his lips.

> “Warning: this action is irreversible. Core path formation will begin upon consumption.”

He took a breath. Then he bit down.

Fire bloomed across his senses. But this was different than before. Not pain—**power**.

Energy surged into him, rushing toward his core. His limbs trembled, his heart thundered. He fell to his knees, clutching his chest as radiant heat expanded within him like a growing sun.

The world around him vanished, replaced by light and motion.

Runes spun. Qi lines burned. The voice echoed distantly.

> “Core alignment detected. Internal system adapting. Mortal Awakening—Stage Two pending…”

His thoughts blurred, body shaking under the strain.

And then, just before the light consumed everything—

He smiled.

He wasn’t just surviving.

He was **changing**.
