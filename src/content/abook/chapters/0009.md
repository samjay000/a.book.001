## **Chapter 9 – The Alchemist’s Trial**

The path beyond the flame hall was narrow, choked with dangling roots and stray glyphs etched into the ceiling like a forgotten script. Aran pressed forward, his fingers grazing the glowing lines that pulsed softly under his touch. The mossy ground crackled beneath his boots, but no wind stirred.

Then he saw the door.

Massive. Circular. Covered entirely in **rune-carved spirals**—a weaving pattern that shimmered the longer he stared at it. It didn’t look locked, but something about it made the hair on his arms rise.

> “Alchemic formation seal,” Veyra said.  
> “A test chamber. Inscriptions indicate it only opens to those who pass the Trial of Tempering.”

Before he could ask, the rune spirals shifted—and the door opened inward with a quiet hiss.

Inside was a circular stone room lit by floating orbs of soft gold flame. It was empty—except for a single **stone table** in the center.

And upon that table…

A **black cauldron**, similar to the one in the flame hall—but larger. Polished. Waiting.

Behind it, a **formation circle** had been etched into the floor, inlaid with copper and silver. Geometric shapes overlapped flowing script and small crystalline insets. To the side, an open alcove held **ten labeled jars**—each containing herbs Aran now recognized: Silveredge, Needle Fern, Ashroot, and more.

A glowing message appeared in the air above the cauldron.

**Trial Initiated: Form and Fire**  
**Objective:**  
– Brew a Stable Minor Healing Elixir  
– Use 3–5 ingredients provided  
– Maintain cauldron heat via Formation Glyphs  
– Time Limit: 15 minutes  
**Failure: Overheat, Instability, or Elixir Rupture**

---

Aran felt a jolt in his chest. He was being timed.

And the room wasn’t powered by flame alone. The **alchemical formation** beneath the cauldron flickered to life, displaying **six glowing nodes** arranged in a circle—each marked with an element or function: _Ignite_, _Stabilize_, _Stir_, _Infuse_, _Vent_, and _Seal_.

> “This is a formation-guided cauldron,” Veyra explained. “Early stage automated brewing model. You must activate glyphs in the correct sequence and balance heat manually.”

Aran took a deep breath. “Right. Let’s do this.”

### 🔬 Scene – Ingredient Selection

He examined the jars, fingers brushing over familiar names:

- **Silveredge Willowleaf** – coagulant  
- **Ashroot Bud** – infection cleanser  
- **Glowcap Fungi Dust** – energy binder  
- **Whisperleaf** – soothes tension  
- **Needle Fern Pulp** – stamina restorer  
- **Spineflower** – bloodflow stimulant  
- **Soilglass Bloom** – adds fluidity

> “Suggested formula,” Veyra said calmly. “Willowleaf + Ashroot + Glowcap for a basic curative tonic. Optional: add Whisperleaf for mild soothing effect.”

He nodded and pulled the ingredients. No hesitation now.

### 🔥 Scene – Glyph and Flame Trial

The moment he dropped the ingredients into the cauldron, the **formation activated fully**.

The node for _Ignite_ pulsed red.

Aran reached out and **pressed his palm to the glyph**—willing his Qi into the circuit. A soft *thrumm* echoed in the stone, and flame burst beneath the cauldron.

The temperature began to rise.

The herbs inside hissed and simmered. Vapor coiled upward like lazy serpents.

Then _Stabilize_ began to blink.

Aran activated it, lowering the heat, steadying the rhythm of the mixture. When it began to swirl unevenly, he tapped _Stir_, and the runes etched into the bottom of the cauldron rotated in place, guiding the brew gently.

Each glyph required **perfect Qi timing**.

Too early, and the ingredients would burn.  
Too late, and they’d separate—**ruining the batch**.

His hands moved instinctively, guided by memory and instinct.

> “Excellent rhythm,” Veyra said. “You’re reading the reactions instead of just reacting.”

But as he moved to activate _Seal_ for the final binding, the **Vent glyph flashed erratically**.

Steam poured upward. The pressure was rising.

“Crap—forgot the Glowcap was too fresh,” Aran muttered.

He yanked the _Vent_ glyph mid-cycle and adjusted his Qi flow—**cooling the brew slightly** just before it boiled over.

The cauldron hissed, then settled.

The liquid inside had turned from cloudy green to a faint amber hue.

A soft chime rang through the chamber.

**Trial Complete**  
**Result:** Tier-1 Minor Healing Elixir – Stable

Aran laughed, sagging slightly as the formation lights dimmed.

His shirt stuck to his back with sweat, and his head throbbed from focusing so hard—but the **elixir was real**. It shimmered faintly in the reinforced vial that rose from the cauldron’s inner ring.

> “You did well,” Veyra said. “Alchemy isn’t just about fire or herb knowledge. It’s timing. Emotion. Balance. You’ve proven you can learn.”

He cradled the vial gently, admiring it.

His first **proper elixir**, made in a trial of flame and formation.

Not just a salve. Not improvised.

Earned.

> “Let’s see if I can do it again,” he whispered, pocketing the vial.

He turned toward the chamber’s second door—now unlocked, the runes slowly unraveling.

And beyond it? Who knew?

More trials. More knowledge. Maybe danger.

But with every step, he was becoming something more than a survivor.

A cultivator. A creator.

And now, an alchemist.
