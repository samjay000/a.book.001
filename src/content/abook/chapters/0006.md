## **Chapter 6 – Greenfire Hollow**

The path twisted into a narrow, root-wrapped stairwell, sloping deeper beneath the ruins. Aran stepped carefully, brushing aside thick vines that drooped from the ceiling like old ropes. Every footfall echoed faintly, swallowed quickly by moss and silence.

Then, the stairs ended.

And the ruin opened into something else entirely.

The air shifted—warm, alive. A vast underground cavern spread before him, cast in a dim, emerald glow. A hollow formed from collapsed stone and nature's reclamation, its ceiling laced with cracks that let in slivers of dim light and glowing spores. Bioluminescent moss crawled across the rock like a living carpet, while strange, slow-moving motes of green fire drifted through the air.

Aran stepped into the **Greenfire Hollow**.

For a moment, he forgot to breathe. This wasn’t part of the structured ruin. This was something that had **grown inside it**—or perhaps something the ruin had once nurtured. A convergence of wild life and ancient cultivation.

Thick vines hugged old stone benches. Carved planters overflowed with vibrant spirit flora. Faintly glowing fungi grew in perfect circles. At the far end of the chamber, a massive tree spread its roots into the stone floor, its trunk hollowed at the base like a temple door.

> “Qi saturation: High. Environmental cycle stable. Estimated age: 400+ years,” Veyra whispered.  
> “This hollow is a remnant of spirit plant farming. Caution advised—spiritual flora may possess semi-sentient defenses.”

Aran moved slowly, reverently.

Each step felt like entering sacred ground.

Near the planters, symbols flared as he passed. Pale blue lines rose from the soil—**glyphs etched into the stone**, forming a circle of overlapping lines and floral designs. A ripple of spiritual light shot outward and—

A **phantom formed**.

Not solid, not threatening—just a projection, an echo.

An old man in flowing robes stood tall before Aran, hands behind his back, surrounded by growing plants.

> “Welcome, heir of breath and soil,” the illusion said.  
> “To tend the land is to understand its pain and its strength. This hollow once fed a sect. May its knowledge feed you.”

The phantom lifted one hand, and images shimmered in the air around it: diagrams of roots, soil layers, glyph arrangements, water channels that pulsed with blue Qi.

Aran’s breath caught.

He was being shown **how to grow power**, not through battle—but through patience. Through care.

By the end of his harvest, Aran had gathered **cuttings or samples of all 11 herbs**, carefully placed in a makeshift pouch lined with moss.

The illusion faded as he worked.

### 📜 Scene – The Journal Fragment

Inside the hollowed base of the great tree, Aran found an old **leatherbound journal**, its pages preserved by a waxy spiritual coating. He flipped through the first few pages—hand-drawn sketches of herbs, personal notes, and a few passages that caught his eye:

> *"Even weeds bend to the spirit’s will if the soil is guided right."*

> *"A proper cultivator tends to the land as he would his own dantian."*

> *"Beware—when spirit fruit begins to ripen, it draws more than eyes. Beasts remember this place. And hunger comes with memory."*

The last passage sent a shiver through him.

### 🌿 Scene – Quiet Resolve

As he packed his things and prepared to leave the Hollow, Aran knelt once more by the edge of the main planter. A single chimeberry bush rustled faintly. A few motes of greenfire drifted past his head, casting his features in glowing light.

> “This place didn’t just teach me how to gather herbs,” he murmured.  
> “It taught me how to grow.”

> “Correct,” Veyra replied. “Integration of cultivation and creation yields stability. Combat is not the only path to power.”

Aran stood.

He would return here—someday.

Maybe not to harvest. Maybe to **plant**.
