## **Chapter 17 – Duskwatch**

The forest broke slowly, tree by tree.

After days of navigating tangled roots and mist-covered glades, the shift was jarring. The trees grew more spaced, the underbrush trimmed into orderly edges. Wooden posts lined the trail—markers carved with faint glyphs to repel beasts and mark territory.

Then he saw it.

**Duskwatch**.

Nestled between low hills and a winding river, the town sprawled outward from a tall stone wall, its buildings pressed close and sharp, like crooked teeth in a cautious smile. Smoke curled gently from chimneys. Flags fluttered at watchtowers. He caught the faint scent of cooked meat and crushed spirit bark in the air.

His first thought was: _It’s so… normal._

And that hit harder than expected.

He hadn’t seen civilization since the attack on Greenveil. The clamor of metal on stone, bartering voices, and the press of human life—none of it belonged to the ruins or the beasts.

Aran stood there at the treeline for a long minute before he stepped onto the road.

The guards at the outer gate barely glanced at him. One, a broad-shouldered cultivator with a dull copper badge, gave him a single up-and-down look.

“Name and purpose?”

“Aran. Selling herbs,” he said simply.

The guard nodded. “Keep weapons sheathed and no spiritual outbursts inside the market ward. You’ll get a fine or a broken rib. Your choice.”

Aran dipped his head and moved on.

The inner ward buzzed with life. Dusty carts creaked across cobblestones. Open-air stalls sold everything from beast jerky to talisman charms. Low-ranking cultivators advertised their services near fountains, and messengers darted between guild buildings.

Despite the activity, Duskwatch wasn’t grand. Its Qi density was thin, and its highest power levels barely tickled his senses. But it was awake—vital. Alive.

And he was part of it.

He wandered the stalls until he spotted a cluster of merchants dealing in herbal goods. Most had bundled spirit grass, dried leaf crates, and powder-pots in well-guarded displays.

He approached one of the cleaner-looking stalls—a shaded tent with silverleaf embroidery on its front banner. A middle-aged woman stood behind a counter, tallying bundles with a practiced eye. Her silver-streaked braid swayed as she moved from pouch to scroll to ledger.

Aran waited until she looked up.

“Looking to buy or sell?” she asked briskly.

“S-sell,” he replied, heart suddenly drumming. “Low-grade spirit herbs. Wild-collected. Preserved.”

She arched a brow. “Let’s see.”

Aran produced three neatly bundled packages: Flamegrass Root, Mistleaf, and Barkmoss. All sealed with wax-thread wrapping and labeled with charcoal glyphs. The woman’s eyes narrowed, but not with suspicion.

She picked up the Flamegrass, unwrapped it, sniffed once, then scraped a corner into a bowl.

“Cut clean. Dried without scorching. Storage Qi still intact…” She gave him a sharp look. “You didn’t learn this in Duskwatch.”

“No,” Aran said. “Outside.”

She considered, then extended a hand. “Maela Ryn. Silverleaf Traders. You’re not licensed with a guild?”

“No.”

“Then I can’t give you full rate. But I can give you fair silver, and not cheat you. Not today anyway.”

Aran blinked, then laughed softly. “Deal.”

He left the stall fifteen minutes later with a small coin pouch containing **nine silver talens** and **twelve copper beads**. Not a fortune—but enough for food, tools, or a shared room for a few nights.

And more importantly—**a foot in the door**.

Maela had offered him temporary work: sorting herbs, cleaning roots, bundling inventory. It paid little but gave him access to **buyers, gossip, and trade mechanics**.

He agreed without hesitation.

That evening, after a long bath in a rented common-house and his first cooked meal in weeks, Aran sat on a rooftop overlooking the dimming market.

Below, torches flickered as vendors packed their goods. The sounds of clinking coins and wheeled carts filled the air. The smell of sweet buns drifted past, teasing his still-hungry stomach.

He pulled out his notebook and began writing.

> **Day 1 – Duskwatch**  
> Sold 3 herb bundles. Learned: spirit herb pricing varies by freshness, storage, and origin.  
> Guild certification required for legal sales in cities. Need a license for Farrowshade markets.  
> Ask Maela about caravans and alchemist exams.

He closed the book and exhaled.

Greenveil was gone.

The ruins were behind him.

But **the road had opened**.

And he was walking it.
