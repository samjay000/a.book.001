## **Chapter 25 – The Trial of Flame and Ink**

The Farrowshade Alchemy Guildhall loomed like a fortress carved from ambition itself.

Rising high into the gray morning sky, it towered over the market square like a silent judge. The walls were shaped from a mix of redstone and blackglass, their surfaces inlaid with veins of green spirit-crystal that pulsed faintly in rhythm with the city’s leylines. Twin spirit flame braziers flanked the main gate, each burning with steady white-blue fire. Above the door, a mural shifted slowly, animated by runes—depicting legendary alchemists of the past mid-craft, their faces both serene and fierce.

Aran adjusted the strap of his satchel and stepped through the main arch.

He wasn’t nervous.

He was **ready**.

The guild hall’s reception chamber was wide and dimly lit, scented with old parchment, mineral ash, and distilled lotus. Dozens of other applicants milled about in whispered clusters. Some wore finely tailored robes stitched with minor spirit-threads, others bore family sigils or sect emblems on their belts.

Aran wore plain traveler’s clothes, reinforced by utility and weeks of field dust. His satchel clinked faintly with glass and root.

They glanced at him, then away—dismissive.

That was fine.

---

He reached the registration table and presented his temporary city token.

The registrar, a middle-aged woman with silver braids and a steel sigil ring, scanned the jade chit and nodded.

“Name?”

“Aran.”

She passed him a small wax-sealed scroll, tied with green twine. “You are candidate 137. Proceed to Examination Hall Three. The trial begins in one hour.”

No congratulations. No commentary. Just process.

Perfect.

---

### **Part I – Theory and Identification**

The chamber was shaped like a tiered theater, with desks set in concentric circles around a central instructor’s dais. Aran took a seat midway up, unrolling the scroll before him. A faint glyph glimmered over the paper—preventing cheating, he assumed.

The first test was simple on the surface:

- Identify 15 labeled herbs and list their ideal infusion temperatures  
- Decode a talisman pattern used in toxin filtration  
- Spot the false answer among a list of heat-reactive minerals

Aran’s eyes flicked down the list, mind sharpening.

He caught the trick question early—**Cloudfern**, mislabeled as having frost affinity, when in fact, its Qi was neutral and only bonded with cold if exposed to Moonroot first. He wrote that calmly and continued on.

Where others muttered or bit their pens in frustration, Aran’s hand moved steadily. The ruins had taught him patience. Raku had taught him how to **see**.

### **Part II – The Brew**

Each candidate was led to an individual brewing station. Aran was assigned to one with a mid-tier cauldron, several mixing tools, and a controlled flame array.

On a side table were three bundles of herbs. Candidates were to choose one, then brew either a **basic healing tonic**, an **energy-restoring elixir**, or a **hybrid formula** with both.

Aran chose hybrid. The hardest.

He selected Ironstem for structure, Tanglevine resin for absorption, and unwrapped the sealed **Spirit Orchard blossom** Raku had given him. It pulsed faintly with living Qi.

He ground the ingredients by hand—slow, methodical, exact. No machine. No shortcuts.

The flame roared to life as he activated the array, guiding heat carefully across five rotations.

Then came the infusion stage.

He tilted the bowl, added the blossom last, and watched the liquid shift—blue fading to green, green folding to gold.

He filtered twice, settled the liquid, and sealed the brew in a cooling crystal jar.

It gleamed.

No fumes. No sediment. No hiss of instability.

Just **clarity**.

---

### **Part III – Essence Infusion**

The final test was the hardest.

Each candidate had to **bind a talisman glyph** to their own brew, stabilizing its essence so it could survive long-term storage or transport.

Aran took the clean parchment and ink brush. His hands were steady, his breath slow. The ink gleamed silver with powdered beastbone.

He began to draw: five anchor points, one central pulse, three trailing flow runes. His glyph was simple, elegant—a model taken from old ruin patterns, modified for modern brewing rates.

One wrong stroke, and the essence would destabilize.

He finished. Lifted the glyph. Placed it on the bottle.

And pulsed **his own Qi** through it.

The glyph flared. The jar thrummed.

Then—**light**.

Soft. Stable. Perfect.

The examiner raised an eyebrow. “Candidate 137. Essence bond successful.”

### **Aftermath**

Hours later, the list of passes was posted just inside the main atrium. Aran didn’t rush to look. He stood at the edge, waiting.

Someone gasped.

Another groaned.

A few names were missing. Some had failed only one part and would be allowed to retake it… after six months.

Then he saw his.

**Aran – Candidate 137 – Pass (All Sections)**

A quiet breath escaped him.

He didn’t smile. But his fingers tightened slightly at his side.

A clerk approached with a small box.

Inside, nestled in cloth, lay a **copper badge etched with a rising flame**—the mark of a **Novice Alchemist**.

> “This grants the bearer permission to brew, sell, and operate within guild guidelines in Farrowshade and affiliate cities. Abuse or criminal use of license will result in seizure, exile, or death.”

> “May you bring clarity through flame.”

---

Outside the hall, the wind had shifted.

The city still bustled. Merchants still shouted. Carts still rolled. Nothing had changed—

Except him.

Aran walked through the crowd, copper badge tucked beneath his collar, satchel at his hip.

Not just surviving.

Now, **acknowledged**.
