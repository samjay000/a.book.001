**Chapter 3 – The Awakening Gift**


Aran was surrounded by darkness, There was no pain or sensation just weightless floating / drifting through  nothingness void.

Then, a single thread of light flickered in the distance.

It started as a pinprick, faint and distant, but then it grew, expanding, consuming the surrounding shadows. 
A warm sensation started to  spread through him, moving coldness away from him seeping from his bones . 
His body felt… different. Energized and stronger. But something else had changed. Something he couldn’t quite grasp.

With a sudden jolt, Aran’s senses roared back to life.

He gasped, his lungs burning as if he had been holding his breath for an eternity.
His eyes snapped open, but the world was blurred, the cavern’s dim glow merging into a hazy smear of light and shadow.
His heart pounded against his ribs, his pulse thundering in his ears.

For a moment, he lay still, adjusting to the sensation of simply existing again. Then, awareness crept back in.

The pool. The voice. The unbearable pain.

But… the pain was gone.

Aran pushed himself upright, half-expecting his limbs to protest. 
Instead, he felt an unfamiliar lightness, as if his body had been freed from some unseen weight.
His skin was clean, the cuts and bruises from before completely healed. 
Even his tattered clothes looked slightly different—less worn, though still ragged.

Then he felt it.

A presence.

Not something physical, but a weight in his mind, like a whisper just beyond hearing. 
It pulsed, like a heartbeat in the depths of his consciousness. Before he could panic, the sensation sharpened, and suddenly—

“Connection established. Host synchronization complete.”

The voice was different from before. Less mechanical, more… personal. Aran tensed, his eyes darting around the cavern, 
but he saw nothing.

“Who’s there?” he asked, his voice hoarse.

“Designated Soul Artifact activated. I am your assistance interface, assigned upon inheritance.”

Aran’s mind reeled. “Soul Artifact…?”

As if responding to his confusion, knowledge flooded into his mind—not in words, but in understanding. 
He saw visions of warriors wielding weapons that responded to their very thoughts, 
of artifacts bound to their owners, growing with them, shaping their destinies. 
A Soul Artifact was more than a weapon or a tool—it was an extension of oneself, bound to the very essence of its wielder.

And now, he had one.

His breathing quickened. “What kind of Soul Artifact?”

“Categorization: Support-Class Artifact. Core Function: Knowledge Retention and Strategic Assistance.”

“…So, not a weapon?”

“Correct. My primary function is to provide guidance, knowledge access, and tactical assessment. 
Additional features will unlock with progression.”

Aran’s heart sank slightly. He had hoped for something more… offensive.
But even as disappointment crept in, another realization struck him.

“Wait. Does that mean you know what’s happening? Where I am?”

“Affirmative. This location is an ancient inheritance site, designed to test and prepare candidates for greater cultivation.”

“Inheritance…” The word felt heavy on his tongue. Something ancient. Something meant to grant power to those worthy. 
But why him? He wasn’t some great warrior or prodigy. He had just been a village boy, running for his life.

His stomach twisted at the memory.

The village. The attack.

How long had it been?

He forced himself to his feet, his mind racing. He had to go back. He had to see if there was anything left, if his family—

“Second stage of inheritance incomplete. Further progression required before departure is advised.”

Aran clenched his fists. “I don’t have time for more tests! I need to get back!”

“Premature departure will significantly reduce survival odds. Current abilities insufficient for hostile encounters.”

He gritted his teeth. He didn’t want to accept it, but he knew the voice wasn’t wrong. He had barely survived before. If those same people were still in the village… he wouldn’t stand a chance as he was now.

He exhaled sharply. “What’s the second stage?”

There was a pause. Then—

“Pick a spirit fruit and consume it.”

As the words resonated in his mind, he looked at small spirit fruit tree on the side full of fruit. 
Lowest ganging fruit has more glow than others surface shimmering with a golden hue. 
It pulsed faintly, as though filled with living energy.

Aran approached cautiously. The fruit was unlike anything he had ever seen—translucent yet solid,
glowing faintly in the cavern’s dim light. He reached out, hesitating only for a moment before picking it. 
The warmth of it seeped into his fingers, sending a strange tingling sensation up his arm.

“This… will help me?”

“The Spirit Fruit will finalize your body’s transformation, fully integrating the refined marrow and enhancing your foundational strength.”

Aran exhaled slowly. There was no turning back. He had already stepped into a world far beyond his understanding. 
He needed every advantage he could get.

He bit into the fruit.

A rush of heat exploded through his veins. Energy surged through his body, coiling within his core, spreading outward in waves. 
It was different from the pool—less painful, but no less intense. His senses sharpened, his vision clearing to a startling clarity. 
The cavern’s details stood out in perfect focus, the air itself seeming to hum with life.

His heart pounded. He felt… powerful.

Then, the knowledge came.

Not forced upon him like before, but unfolding naturally. Techniques. Theories. The structure of cultivation itself. His mind absorbed it all, his very being reshaped by the essence of the Spirit Fruit.

His Soul Artifact stirred in response, its presence strengthening within him.

“Integration complete. Mortal Awakening: Stage One achieved.”

Aran’s breath caught in his throat. He had stepped onto the path of power. A path that would take him beyond being a helpless village boy. A path that might give him the strength to take back what had been stolen.

His hands clenched into fists. He would see his home again. He would uncover the truth behind the attack. And, if the ones responsible were still out there…

They would regret ever crossing him.

“Next directive: Proceed to artifact selection.”

A new glow pulsed within the cavern, further into the darkness.

Aran took a deep breath, steadying himself.

Then, without hesitation, he stepped forward.

***End of chapter 3***

**Chapter 4 – Rebirth in Fire**

Aran awoke to silence.

For a long moment, he did not move. He simply lay there, eyes half-lidded, his mind sluggish, his body strangely weightless. His breath came slow, steady, each inhale filling his lungs with a crispness that felt almost too pure, too different.  The lingering memories of pain still sent chill through his spine.

Memories came rushing back. The glowing pool. The searing agony. His very bones felt as though they had been broken and reforged, each fiber of his being twisted and reshaped into something new. Well he was simply happy to be alive.

He open his eye slowly, place hasn't changed. Rune  covered pillars still standing around him. Instead of foreign feeling he had about those pillars earlier now he feel familiar to them.

He sat up slowly, testing his limbs. His body no longer ached with exhaustion. The weakness he had felt before was gone, replaced by an unfamiliar lightness, an energy that thrummed beneath his skin. He clenched his fists experimentally. The grip was strong, sure. His hands, which had once been calloused from years of rough work, now felt smoother—denser, even.

The voice returned.

**"Bone marrow refinement complete. Candidate has successfully adapted."**

Aran exhaled sharply.

Adapted? To **what**?

Before he could fully process the question, a faint glow appeared before him. It took him a moment to realize what he was seeing—a translucent screen, suspended in the air, its surface shifting with lines of text written in an unfamiliar but somehow comprehensible script.

---

**Name:** Aran
**Status:** Mortal Awakening Stage 1
**Affinity:** Undetermined
**Bone Marrow Purification:** 100% Completed
**Physical Enhancement:** +20% Strength, +30% Endurance, +15% Agility
**Energy Circulation:** Qi Nodes Unlocked – Lower Dantian

---

His pulse quickened.

**This... this is real.**

It wasn’t a hallucination. The numbers, the words, the interface—it all pulsed with an undeniable presence. He reached out hesitantly, his fingers passing through the text like mist, but he could **feel** it, like a subtle pressure in the air.

A thought surfaced in his mind, unbidden yet perfectly clear. **This is knowledge. An inheritance.**

He swallowed hard. If he had any doubts before, they were gone now. This was no ordinary place. Whatever had pulled him here had given him something—changed him. The question was: for what purpose?

**"Proceed to the next phase?"** the voice intoned once more.

Aran hesitated. His instincts screamed at him to be cautious, but he already knew the answer. There was no going back. Not yet.

He nodded. "Yes."

The moment the word left his lips, the chamber responded.

The runes on the walls flared, casting shifting shadows as the air around him grew denser, charged with invisible power. A new structure emerged from the far side of the chamber—an altar-like pedestal, upon which rested a small, golden fruit, its surface pulsing with an inner light.

**"Consume the Elixir Fruit. Second refinement will commence."**

Aran approached cautiously, his every step measured. The fruit was warm to the touch, radiating a gentle heat that seeped into his fingertips. He hesitated only briefly before bringing it to his lips.

The moment he bit into it, **fire** exploded in his veins.

He choked back a cry as raw energy surged through him, spreading from his core to every limb. It was different from the pain of the pool—this was a force **burning** through him, reshaping him from the inside out. He could feel it, his very cells drinking in the energy, greedily absorbing the untapped power.

His vision blurred, his knees buckling as he collapsed to the ground. The chamber faded, swallowed by an endless sea of white-hot intensity.

His heartbeat pounded in his ears, faster and faster, until—

**Silence.**

Then, clarity.

Something settled within him, like a key turning in a lock. A second pulse of energy, cooler this time, spread through his being, smoothing out the raging storm that had nearly consumed him. His mind sharpened, thoughts aligning with an ease he had never known before. The sluggishness of his past self was gone, replaced by something **more.**

He understood now.

This was the **second refinement**—not just of body, but of mind and spirit. The interface shifted again, new words appearing before his eyes.

---

**Mortal Awakening Stage 2 Achieved**
**Qi Circulation Enhanced**
**Physical Capabilities Increased**
**Awakened: Soul Artifact - Unbound**

---

Soul artifact?

Before he could ponder its meaning, a strange sensation tugged at his very being. From within his core, something stirred, something **alive**. He gasped as a flickering light formed before him, slowly solidifying into an object—a ring, simple yet exquisite, its surface inscribed with minute runes, pulsating faintly.

The knowledge came unbidden, like a whisper in his mind.

**A soul-bound artifact. A guide, a tool, an anchor.**

The ring shimmered, its energies brushing against him, recognizing him, binding to him. He knew instinctively that it was his, that it would grow with him, shape itself to his will.

Then, as the chamber finally settled into stillness once more, the voice spoke for the final time.

**"The inheritance is accepted. The journey begins."**

Aran closed his eyes, steadying his breath. His path had irrevocably changed. He was no longer the boy who had fled his village in fear.

He was something more.

And whatever lay ahead, he was ready.

---

***End of chapter 4***

---

**Chapter 5 – Awakening to Power**

Aran felt tired and dull pain through out his body. While slowly getting his consciousness back. He felt his body, muscles become something new, strong, vigorous. Like they had been re-forged in fire, every fiber of his being stretched and molded into something new.

He lay in silence with shallow breaths while clarity returned.

A soft light bathed the place, runes in pilars are dimming slowly.
He did not feel sluggishness of exhaustion that he felt earlier, Instead he felt  strength hummed beneath his skin, his senses sharper, his awareness more keener.  He even felt mana flowing in the air.

Aran slowly sat up, flexing his fingers. The cuts and bruises that once marred his body were gone. His tattered clothes still clung to him, but beneath the fabric, his skin felt sturdier, his muscles denser. Whatever had happened in that pool—it had changed him.

The voice returned, calm and ever-present.

“**Bone marrow refinement complete. Candidate has surpassed baseline physical limits. Initiating next phase.**”

Aran tensed. Before he could respond, voice told him to

“**pick a one spirit fruit and Consume the spirit fruit to stabilize your transformation.**”

His gaze flickered between the fruit tree and the surrounding cavern. The last time he had followed instructions, it had led to excruciating pain. Yet, deep within, a hunger stirred—an instinctual need to absorb the energy within the fruit.

He reached out, his fingers brushing against its smooth surface. The moment he grasped it, warmth spread up his arm, a comforting contrast to the cavern’s chill. Without hesitation, he brought it to his lips and took a bite.

The taste was unlike anything he had ever experienced—sweet, yet layered with an invigorating richness that sent a surge of energy through his veins. As he swallowed, the warmth intensified, spreading through his limbs, his core, his very soul. His mind sharpened, clarity settling into his thoughts like pieces of a puzzle falling into place.

Then, the rush came.

His vision blurred as a flood of knowledge poured into him, searing itself into his consciousness. Concepts he had never encountered before—Qi circulation, energy control, meridian pathways—unfolded within his mind as if he had always known them. It was as though another presence had taken root within him, guiding him, explaining the newfound changes within his body.

A presence that spoke.

“**Soul Artifact Integration successful. Assistance module activated.**”

Aran gasped, his hands flying to his head as the sensation stabilized. The voice—different from the previous one—was softer, more familiar. It felt… connected to him.

He took a deep breath, centering himself. The information settled, no longer overwhelming. He could feel it now—his Qi, a gentle current flowing within, ready to be shaped, harnessed.

He wasn’t just Aran anymore. He was something more.

The cavern shifted, as if sensing his transformation. The runes along the walls brightened, their glow casting intricate patterns across the stone floor. The original voice returned.

“**Candidate has achieved first-stage ascension. As a reward, three artifacts shall be bestowed.**”

Aran straightened, anticipation coursing through him. Three small flashes of light appeared before him, coalescing into tangible objects. He reached forward, carefully inspecting them.

The first was a ring—simple in design, yet imbued with an aura of concealment. The moment his fingers closed around it, an understanding bloomed in his mind.

**“Concealment Ring – Hides the user’s cultivation level and scent, providing safety in hostile environments.”**

The second artifact was another ring, though slightly heavier, its inside surface etched with spatial runes.

**“Storage Ring – Grants a personal space for storing items. Capacity expands with cultivation growth.”**

His fingers closed around the final object—a third ring, yet unlike the others. It felt like useless ordinary graphit ring without any energy reading or any runes.

**“World Ring – A mini-dimension designed for growing cultivation resources. Fully activates upon reaching Foundation Establishment.”**

Aran exhaled, overwhelmed yet exhilarated. He had come to this place battered, lost, and alone. Now, he stood on the precipice of something greater. He clenched his fist, feeling the pulse of energy within him.

For the first time since waking in the cavern, he smiled.

He was ready to begin his journey.

The runes flickered one final time before dimming, the voice offering its last decree.

“**Exit pathway unlocked. Step forward, and the path shall reveal itself.**”

Aran took one last look around, imprinting the cavern into his memory. Then, with a steady breath, he stepped forward into the unknown.

***End of chapter 5***

**Chapter 6 – Return to the Wild**

The world twisted around Aran as he stepped through the portal, his vision fracturing like shards of glass before snapping back together. A rush of wind roared past his ears, his stomach twisting in protest as he felt himself **falling**—not through space, but through something deeper, something unseen.

Then, with a sharp jolt, he landed on solid ground.

Damp earth pressed beneath his palms, the rich scent of the jungle filling his lungs. The familiar sounds of rustling leaves and distant creatures met his ears, a stark contrast to the unnatural silence of the ancient ruins. He sucked in a breath, his pulse steadying. **I’m back.**

The jungle canopy above was thick, letting in only thin slivers of golden sunlight. The warmth of late afternoon pressed against his skin, beads of sweat already forming along his brow. He looked around, eyes scanning his surroundings. **Duskwood Jungle.**

He recognized the gnarled trees, the moss-covered stones, the faint sound of a nearby creek trickling over smooth river rocks. This was **near the place where he had first been taken.**

A cold realization settled in his chest. His village was close. Just beyond the tree line, past the low hills. But so was the memory of **fire, blood, and screams.**

His hands curled into fists. He couldn't rush in. Not yet. There were too many unknowns.

And night was falling.

---

### **Shelter Among the Trees**

Aran had no intention of walking blindly into the darkness. He had learned enough from his parents’ expeditions to know that the jungle at night was not a place for the careless.

With practiced ease, he moved through the underbrush, his senses sharper than before. The jungle’s pulse was clearer now—the rustling of unseen creatures, the distant calls of spirit beasts, the faint hum of Qi-infused plants hidden beneath the foliage. **His body had changed, and so had his awareness.**

After some time, he found what he was looking for—a massive fallen tree, its roots forming a hollowed-out space beneath. It was concealed, defensible, and just large enough for him to fit inside. **Perfect.**

Before settling in, he gathered **Spiritwood Leaves**—broad, dark-green foliage that masked scent—scattering them around his shelter’s entrance. It wasn’t foolproof, but it would help hide him from predators.

As the last traces of sunlight faded, he finally allowed himself to breathe.

**One night. Just one night. Then I move.**

---

### **Hunger and the Jungle’s Bounty**

His stomach growled, the dull ache of hunger gnawing at him. He hadn’t eaten properly since leaving the ruins, and the strain of his new body demanded sustenance.

Pushing himself up, he took stock of his supplies. **The storage ring.** A simple thought willed it to open, and within its vast space, a few items hovered in his consciousness—some dried meat from the ruins, a small flask of spring water, and several spirit herbs he had yet to identify.

None of it would last him long.

With careful steps, he ventured out, eyes scanning the undergrowth. It didn’t take long before he spotted his first find—**Starvine Berries.** Small, deep blue fruits clinging to twisted vines, pulsing faintly with Qi.

He plucked a few, rolling them between his fingers. They weren’t much, but they would do.

He ate quickly, savoring the tart sweetness that exploded across his tongue. Almost immediately, warmth spread through his limbs, the exhaustion in his muscles lessening. **A low-grade spirit fruit, good for stamina recovery.**

Satisfied, he returned to his shelter, reinforcing his hiding spot before settling in.

For the first time in days, he allowed his body to relax. His muscles loosened, his breathing slowed, and within minutes, sleep took him.

---

### **The Predator in the Dark**

Something **snapped.**

Aran’s eyes shot open. His heartbeat surged as his body reacted before his mind could process the danger.

Silence.

Then, the faintest shift in the leaves outside. A presence. **Something was out there. Watching.**

He forced himself to breathe evenly, his fingers tightening around the sharp bone dagger he had crafted earlier. His Qi, still unfamiliar but potent, pulsed in response. **Stay still. Listen.**

A deep growl rumbled in the darkness.

Then, a pair of eyes emerged from the shadows—a low, slinking form **too large for a panther, too small for a bear.** Its fur shimmered faintly, reflecting the moonlight filtering through the canopy.

**A Duskfang Stalker.**

Aran clenched his jaw. **Stronger than a normal beast. Slightly above my level.**

The creature sniffed the air, circling the fallen tree. It couldn’t see him, but it could **sense** him.

It prowled closer, muscles tensing. **It’s going to pounce.**

Aran’s body moved on instinct. As the beast lunged, he **rolled to the side**, evading the strike by a breath’s width. Claws slashed against the bark where he had been moments ago, splintering wood like paper.

He landed in a crouch, dagger raised.

The Stalker growled, eyes locking onto him. Then, it lunged again.

This time, Aran was ready.

He dodged left, his dagger flashing as he **struck toward its exposed side**. The blade met flesh, slicing deep. The beast roared, staggering back, but not before its hind leg lashed out—

**Impact.**

Pain flared in Aran’s ribs as he was knocked back against the fallen tree. He gasped, but forced himself to stay on his feet. His vision blurred for half a second—

No. **Focus.**

The Stalker was wounded, but still dangerous. It circled him again, slower this time, wary of another strike. **It’s learning.**

Aran exhaled, forcing his body into a ready stance. His Qi stirred, aligning with his instincts.

The Stalker lunged a third time, but this time, **Aran stepped into the attack.**

His dagger drove forward, aiming not for the flesh, but for the throat.

**A clean strike.**

The beast let out a choked snarl, its body convulsing before collapsing in a heap.

Silence returned to the jungle.

Aran remained still, panting, his entire body trembling. **I did it.**

He **won.**

After a moment, he wiped the blood from his blade and retrieved anything useful from the Stalker’s corpse. The fangs and hide would sell well in Emberhold. More importantly, its **beast core**—a small, pulsing gem embedded in its chest—was a rare resource for cultivation.

He pocketed the core and took one last look at the fallen beast.

Then, without another word, he turned and vanished back into the trees.

Tomorrow, he would continue his journey. **The village awaited.**

---

***End of chapter 6***

---

**Chapter 7 – A Night in the Jungle**

The jungle never truly slept.

Even as the moon cast silver rays through the dense canopy, the wilderness was alive with movement. Leaves rustled as unseen creatures slinked through the underbrush. In the distance, the deep, guttural roar of a spirit beast sent smaller animals skittering away. Insects hummed, their droning song blending with the steady rhythm of nature.

Aran sat within his makeshift shelter, his back pressed against the rough bark of the fallen tree. The scent of earth and damp leaves filled his nose, grounding him. His body still thrummed with the lingering energy from his battle with the Duskfang Stalker, but exhaustion gnawed at the edges of his mind.

He needed rest. But rest in the jungle was never easy.

He tightened his grip on his dagger, its cool weight reassuring in his palm. He had won today, but the jungle would not always be so forgiving. His senses had sharpened after the inheritance, but he still lacked true experience. **I need to get stronger.**

With a deep breath, he let his body relax, trusting in his concealment and the Spiritwood Leaves to mask his presence. Slowly, he drifted into a light sleep—one where he could wake at the slightest disturbance.

---

### **Dreams of Fire and Blood**

Sleep came, but it was not peaceful.

The village square. The acrid stench of smoke. The screams of the dying.

Aran’s breath came fast, his heart hammering against his ribs. He saw it all—the dark figures moving like shadows, the glint of steel under the sun, the helpless villagers falling one by one.

He turned, searching for his family, but the world twisted, shifting into a scene from long ago.

A woman’s voice. **His mother.**

“Aran, listen carefully. If anything ever happens, you must survive. No matter what.”

The memory blurred, dissolving into darkness.

---

Aran’s eyes snapped open.

His breath was ragged, his fingers clenched so tightly around his dagger that his knuckles turned white. His heart pounded, the dream still clinging to him like a phantom pain.

It had been years since he last had dreams of his mother’s warnings.

Exhaling slowly, he forced his hands to relax. The past was gone. But the future? That was his to claim.

A faint sound pulled him back to the present. A soft rustle. **Too deliberate.**

Instantly alert, Aran remained still, his fingers tightening around his weapon. His sharpened senses extended outward, searching the darkness. The jungle’s usual noises were unchanged, but there—just beyond the fallen tree—something moved.

He waited.

Another shift. Slow. Measured. **Stalking.**

Aran’s muscles coiled like a spring. Then—

A flash of movement.

A shape lunged from the underbrush, its gleaming eyes locking onto him.

A **Nightshade Serpent.**

---

### **The Serpent’s Strike**

Aran rolled to the side as the serpent struck, its fangs embedding into the bark where his head had been moments ago. The tree shuddered under the force. He sprang to his feet, dagger raised, heart hammering.

The serpent coiled, its obsidian-black scales gleaming under the moonlight. It wasn’t a massive beast, but what it lacked in size, it made up for in speed and venom. Its forked tongue flicked out, tasting the air. Then, with a low hiss, it lunged again.

Aran dodged left, feeling the wind from the strike brush against his arm. The serpent’s speed was terrifying—**faster than the Duskfang Stalker.**

**I can’t outrun it. I have to end this quickly.**

He steadied his stance, drawing on his refined Qi. His body moved with newfound fluidity, his instincts sharper than ever. The serpent struck again, but this time, he was ready.

At the last second, he **stepped into the attack**—

His dagger flashed, slicing through the air.

The blade met flesh.

A clean, precise cut.

The serpent let out a final, shuddering hiss before collapsing into the dirt.

Aran exhaled, his pulse still racing. His hands were steady, but beneath the surface, he felt it—the rush of battle, the clarity of motion, the thrill of victory.

He knelt, inspecting the serpent’s corpse.

Its **fangs** were valuable, filled with paralytic venom often used in alchemy. The **scales**—reinforced with natural Qi—could be fashioned into light armor or sold for a high price. More importantly, when he split open its skull, he found what he was hoping for—a **beast core.**

A small, pulsating crystal nestled within the creature’s brain. It glowed faintly with Qi, a rare find at his level.

This… **this is worth something.**

Stowing his spoils in his storage ring, he wiped the sweat from his brow. The jungle had tested him again. And again, he had proven himself.

But he couldn’t afford to let his guard down.

The night was not over yet.

---

### **The First Step Toward Mastery**

Aran returned to his shelter, feeling the strain creeping into his limbs. He had fought twice now in the span of hours, and while his body was stronger than before, he wasn’t invincible.

Still, he had gained more than he had lost. He now had **his first beast core.** His body was adjusting to combat, his instincts sharpening. He was learning.

He had no master to guide him, no sect to rely on.

But that didn’t matter.

Sitting cross-legged inside his shelter, he pulled the beast core from his ring, turning it over in his palm. He could **feel** the energy within. Wild. Untamed. If refined properly, it could help accelerate his cultivation.

Aran closed his eyes, drawing in a slow breath. He focused, extending his Qi outward, feeling the connection between himself and the core.

A small pulse. A thread of energy. **A beginning.**

For the first time, he wasn’t just surviving.

He was growing stronger.

---

Tomorrow, he would continue his journey.

The village awaited.

---

***End of chapter 7***

---

**Chapter 8 – Battle in the Wilds**

The first rays of dawn cut through the dense jungle canopy, casting golden streaks across the damp earth. Aran stood at the edge of his makeshift shelter, stretching his limbs and rolling his shoulders. His body was sore, but not unbearably so. He could feel it—his muscles adapting, his Qi settling more naturally within him.

Last night’s encounter with the **Nightshade Serpent** had been a harsh reminder. **Strength alone wasn’t enough. He needed experience.**

And the jungle would provide it.

With a final glance at his surroundings, he adjusted his grip on his dagger and pressed forward.

---

### **The Jungle’s Trial**

The underbrush was thick, but Aran moved with confidence. He had walked these trails before, though his senses now picked up details he would have missed in the past—the subtle footprints of smaller creatures, the faint Qi signatures of spirit plants hiding beneath the roots of ancient trees, the soft rumble of a beast moving in the distance.

He kept his pace steady, his eyes scanning for both threats and opportunities. The further he went, the more he realized how **different** he was from before. The jungle no longer felt like an insurmountable maze—it was alive, its rhythms and dangers something he could read and navigate.

Then, the jungle **shifted.**

A sudden silence. The birds that had been chirping moments ago had vanished. Even the wind seemed to pause.

Something was coming.

Aran halted, his grip tightening on his weapon. He lowered his stance, his senses reaching outward.

A **low growl.**

Then, from the foliage ahead, **a massive figure burst forth.**

---

### **The Bloodscale Boar**

The beast was **huge**—easily twice Aran’s size, its thick hide covered in jagged, crimson-tinged scales. Its tusks gleamed, their edges chipped and cracked from years of battle.

A **Bloodscale Boar.**

Aran barely had time to react before it **charged.**

Instinct took over. He threw himself to the side as the beast barreled past, its sheer momentum uprooting smaller trees in its path. Dust and broken branches filled the air as the creature skidded to a halt, turning its enraged gaze toward him.

It was fast. Too fast for something that size.

Aran exhaled sharply, resetting his stance. **This wasn’t like the Nightshade Serpent. This was pure brute force.**

The boar charged again, its hooves thundering against the earth.

Aran **moved.**

At the last second, he sidestepped, his dagger flashing as he aimed for the exposed flesh near its front leg. The blade met resistance—**thick hide.** Too shallow.

The boar **swung its head**, its tusk barely missing his ribs as he leapt back.

It wasn’t just fast. It was smart.

Aran gritted his teeth. **No prolonged fight. I need to end this quickly.**

He scanned the terrain, searching for an opening. The boar’s back was well-armored, its sides layered with tough scales. But its movements—**every time it charged, there was a brief opening beneath its jaw.**

He waited.

The boar snorted, its breath steaming in the morning air. Then, with a furious roar, it lunged one final time.

Aran **darted forward.**

The moment before impact, he dropped to the ground, **sliding beneath the beast’s massive head.** His dagger shot upward, piercing the unarmored flesh beneath its throat.

A wet **gurgle** escaped the boar’s mouth as it staggered, its momentum carrying it forward even as blood gushed from the wound. It stumbled once. Twice.

Then, with a final heaving breath, it collapsed.

---

### **Victory and Spoils**

Aran remained still for a moment, his chest rising and falling in sharp breaths. His arms ached, his body humming with the aftermath of battle.

**He had won.**

Slowly, he pushed himself to his feet, approaching the fallen creature. He had no time to waste—**the scent of blood would attract others.**

Working quickly, he retrieved his dagger and cut into the boar’s thick hide, searching for what he needed. The beast’s **heartstone**—a condensed core of Qi that resided near the heart—was his main prize. Once located, he extracted it, wiping his blade clean.

The stone **pulsed** in his palm, faint wisps of energy curling around his fingers. This was **valuable.** Not just as currency, but as a resource for his own cultivation.

Beyond the heartstone, he took the tusks and some of the tougher hide before stepping away.

A rustling in the distance made him tense.

Time to move.

---

### **Moving Forward**

Aran left the carcass behind, increasing his pace. He could feel it—the jungle stirring in response to the fresh kill. Predators would come.

But he wouldn’t be here when they arrived.

As he traveled, his mind turned over the fight. **He was getting better. Faster. Smarter.**

The inheritance had given him the tools, but it was the wild that was sharpening him into something more. He wasn’t just surviving.

**He was evolving.**

The village was getting closer. But before he returned, there was one last thing he needed to do.

**Find more cultivation resources.**

With renewed purpose, Aran pressed on, deeper into the jungle.

The path ahead awaited.

**Chapter 9 – Treasures of the Wild**

Aran moved swiftly, his steps light and deliberate. The jungle still pulsed with life behind him, but he had put enough distance between himself and the fallen Bloodscale Boar to avoid immediate danger. The air carried the scent of damp earth and distant rain, but his focus was elsewhere—**finding resources.**

He had power, but power alone wouldn’t be enough. Cultivation required **nourishment, refinement, and patience.** And the jungle was filled with opportunities for those who knew where to look.

---

### **The First Find – Moonshade Flowers**

A faint shimmer in the underbrush caught Aran’s eye. He slowed his steps, crouching beside the twisted roots of an ancient tree. Nestled within the gnarled wood, veiled in soft silver light, were **Moonshade Flowers**.

His lips curled in satisfaction.

Moonshade Flowers were **rare**, known for their ability to enhance Qi circulation. Even at his level, refining them into an elixir could grant him noticeable improvements. Carefully, he plucked the delicate blossoms, ensuring the roots remained undisturbed—**a sustainable harvest meant the jungle would continue to provide.**

He tucked the flowers into his storage ring before standing, scanning the area for more. **One good find. Now to keep going.**

---

### **The Second Find – Starvine Berries**

Deeper into the jungle, he spotted another promising sign—a thin vine wrapped around the trunk of a fallen tree, its tiny berries glowing faintly in the dim light. **Starvine Berries.**

Aran reached out and plucked one, rolling it between his fingers. These berries were known for their ability to **restore stamina and soothe fatigue.**

He popped one into his mouth.

A burst of tartness spread across his tongue, followed by a slow, spreading warmth. Almost immediately, the lingering exhaustion from his earlier battle **lessened**.

A useful find. He gathered a handful and stored them.

The jungle wasn’t just dangerous—it was **generous** to those who understood it.

---

### **The Third Find – Spiritroot**

His greatest find of the day came when he followed a faint energy pulse to the base of an old rock formation. The air here **felt different**—denser, filled with an unspoken presence. **Something was buried beneath the soil.**

With careful hands, he began digging, loosening the dirt until his fingers brushed against something solid. A thick root, coiled like a sleeping serpent, pulsed softly with golden veins.

**Spiritroot.**

Aran exhaled in disbelief. This was far more valuable than the Moonshade Flowers or Starvine Berries. Spiritroot was a **powerful cultivation aid**, strengthening both body and Qi foundation. It was something most early-stage cultivators **would never have access to.**

Excitement surged through him as he unearthed the root, brushing away excess soil. It was large—easily enough for multiple uses. He carefully stored it, already planning how best to refine it.

His journey back to the village had already paid off.

---

### **A Moment of Reflection**

As Aran stood, he glanced back at the jungle behind him. **Days ago, this place had been a death trap. Now, it felt like an extension of himself.**

He had fought. He had survived. He had adapted.

And now, he was **reaping the rewards.**

But his mission wasn’t over yet.

With one last look at his surroundings, he turned toward the distant silhouette of his village.

The final stretch awaited.

**Chapter 10 – Shadows Over Greenveil**

The jungle thinned as Aran reached the outskirts of Greenveil Village.

From his vantage point atop a rocky hill, he could see the village’s silhouette against the darkening sky. Smoke curled faintly from a few chimneys, but the village was eerily quiet. **Too quiet.**

His breath was steady, but his pulse quickened. **How much had changed? Was it even safe to return?**

He crouched low, eyes scanning the terrain. **Don’t rush in. Observe first.**

---

### **Lurking in the Shadows**

Aran remained hidden within the tree line, waiting as twilight deepened into night. He saw movement—a handful of villagers going about their tasks, but fewer than he remembered. He spotted no signs of lingering attackers, but that didn’t mean there weren’t hidden dangers.

He needed to be sure.

For hours, he circled the village’s perimeter, watching, listening. He recognized some of the people, but others were missing. Some houses were abandoned, windows broken. **Had the survivors fled? Or had they been taken?**

His jaw tightened. **This wasn’t the village he had left.**

Satisfied that there were no immediate threats, he took his next step.

---

### **Returning Home**

Moving under the cover of darkness, Aran slipped through familiar paths, avoiding open streets. His destination was clear—his family home.

As he reached the small wooden house at the village’s edge, his chest tightened. **Would they be there?**

The door was slightly ajar. He pushed it open, his senses sharp for any sign of movement.

Silence.

The house was untouched, as though time had frozen since the day he had been taken. Dust had begun to settle on surfaces, but nothing was in disarray. There were no signs of struggle, no bloodstains, no broken furniture. **They hadn’t been forced out. They had left willingly.**

His fingers brushed against the old wooden table where they had once shared meals. His siblings’ belongings were gone, as were his parents’ personal effects. **They had taken what they could.**

They had planned this.

---

### **A Hidden Message**

A sudden thought struck him. **The hiding spot.**

He moved swiftly, stepping toward the hearth. Beneath the fireplace’s loose stone, he and his sister had once left secret messages as children. His breath caught as he lifted the stone and found a **folded parchment** tucked neatly within.

His mother’s handwriting.

With steady hands, he unfolded the letter and read.

---

**My dear Aran,**

**We know you are alive.**

**Your father and I waited as long as we could, but the situation is dangerous. The ones who attacked our village are old enemies. We could not risk staying.**

**We have returned to the capital.**

**Find us there.**

**Seek out the shop named ‘Emberleaf Trading’ and ask for ‘Master Ren Liang.’ He will guide you.**

**Do not use your real name. Do not reveal who you are.**

**The ones who attacked us may still be searching. Until you are strong enough, you must hide.**

**Survive, my son. We will be waiting.**

**—Mother**

---

### **A New Path Forward**

Aran exhaled slowly, his fingers tightening around the parchment. **They knew. They had always known.**

His family had **waited for him**, but they hadn’t been able to stay. And now, they were in **the capital.**

A place he had never seen. A place whose name now carried the weight of his future.

**Auriven.**

His heart pounded. He wasn’t just returning to the village.

**He was setting out on a journey far greater than he had ever imagined.**
