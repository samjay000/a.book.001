**Chapter 1: Awakening in Darkness**


Even though he felt groggy, biting back a groan, pushed himself upright, and took in his surroundings.
Then he took a deep breath, and his nostrils filled with a sharp, metallic smell that felt like blood.
He isn't sure what is going on or where he is.

***Aran*** is in pain.

There are small cuts all over his body, and his clothes are in tatters. He didn't feel any strength in his body.
He is submerged in water, with some trouble he dragged himself out of the water.
After spending all his strength dragging himself, he lost consciousness again.

----

Some time later he woke up, he barely remembered dragging himself out of the pond. 
Then he looks around to figure out where he is. 
He lay sprawled on cold stone there were a few stone pillars filled with runes and several water pools in the corners.
The floor, ceiling, and walls covered with various formations. 
Runes in pillars still have some flickering luminous hue.

For a brief moment, panic seized him. Where the f…k am I?

Memory drifted back like smoke through cracked windows. 
Aran was running from something or someone when he was dragged into a space hole in the air, 
some kind of teleporting, Aran thought. Then he remembered.

The fight.

He was trading blows with Jarik Thorne, the village’s most notorious bully. 
According to the village rules, every kid between 10 and 16 had to collect matured spirit grass from fields. 
But Jarik never collected his share of herbs he was a bully who took small portions from other kids to fix his quota. 
When Jarik decides to get a portion of Aran’s herb collection, Aran refuses to give it, and they start fighting for herbs.

But then… the village square had erupted into screams.

Several men cloaked in ragged shadows had stepped into Greenveil Village they were covering all the exits from the village.
And start killing people. Aran could still hear the screams and the sound of steel biting into flesh. 
Some villagers try to, the crackle of energy too powerful to belong in a peaceful place like Greenveil.

He ran. He had sprinted into the Duskwood Jungle, following half-remembered paths his parents had shown him long ago.

Only something had gone terribly wrong. The air had shifted. 
The hole appears in the air and drags him toward the unknown. In no time he was in an unfamiliar place.

Then the voice had come. “New Candidate Detected. Commencing Preliminary Evaluation.”

That was the last thing Aran remembered before waking up here.
Aran froze. His heart slammed against his chest, his breath catching in his throat.

The voice was not human. It was something else—ancient, emotionless, powerful.

Before he could react, an invisible force wrapped around him.

The pain, it was sudden, all-consuming. A searing heat spread through his body, as if molten fire had been injected into his veins. 
His muscles spasmed, his bones ached, his very essence felt like it was being unraveled and reformed all at once.
He gasped, his fingers clawing at the stone beneath him, but there was no escape.
His vision blurred, his consciousness flickering.

Then, just as suddenly as it began, the pain vanished.

The voice returned, as indifferent as ever.

“Evaluation complete. Candidate has passed.”

Aran gasped, his entire body trembling. His breath came in ragged bursts, sweat dripping down his face. 
He had no idea what had just happened, but he knew, instinctively, that he had been changed somehow.

“Do you wish to proceed to the second stage?”

He hesitated. His body still ached, his mind still reeled. 
But something deep inside told him that refusal was not an option. 
He swallowed hard, his voice hoarse as he forced out a single word.

“Yes.”

The runes on the pillars flared, their glow intensifying.

“Enter the pool. The process will begin.”

Aran turned to the water he had crawled from. 
This time, the surface shimmered, a faint glow radiating from its depths. 
His instincts screamed at him to stay away, to run, to escape. But there was nowhere to go.

He stepped forward, the cold liquid swallowing him once more. Fire. 
Not from the outside, but within. His bones burned, his very marrow searing as if molten gold had been poured into them. 
His muscles tore apart and stitched themselves back together, each fiber reforged stronger than before. 
His blood surged, his veins expanding, his very being reshaped by an ancient power.

Aran tried to scream, but his vision darkened.
Then, there was nothing.
