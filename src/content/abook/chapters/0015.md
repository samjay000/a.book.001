## **Chapter 15 – Return to Ash and Green**

The jungle had grown quieter as Aran approached the edge.

He recognized the curve of the hills now, the winding paths through the underbrush. The scent of moss and tree sap gave way to drier air, and the shadows thinned.

He paused atop a rocky ridge, brushing vines from his path, and looked out beyond the treeline.

His breath caught in his throat.

There it was.

Or what was left of it.

**Greenveil Village**.

### 🌫️ Scene – Scars of Home

From above, the village looked like a memory burned into parchment. Ash-streaked rooftops. Collapsed homes overtaken by grass. Smoke-darkened stones long cooled.

Aran walked the path slowly, boots crunching against cracked flagstones and dried leaves.

He passed the well—its rope long broken, bucket shattered. The herb-sorting tables were overturned, mold eating at the wood.

Everything smelled… old.

Empty.

He stepped into what had once been his home. The door barely hung on its hinges. Inside, only broken shelves and dusty tools.

He stood still, staring at the marks on the wall—the ones he and his siblings had carved to measure height each summer.

They were still there.

Smaller than he remembered.

### 🔥 Scene – Memories in the Dust

The silence felt sacred.

Every broken bowl. Every fallen beam.

They weren’t just ruins. They were **echoes**.

Aran closed his eyes and let the memories rise.

Running across the clearing with his little brother. Watching his father sharpen a machete while humming tunelessly. Helping his mother label herb bundles. His sister teasing him when he burned stew again.

He gritted his teeth.

They had been here.

Now they were gone.

But he hadn’t found their bodies. Not a trace.

> “They escaped,” he whispered. “Please… please let them have escaped.”

### 📜 Scene – The Message

He searched the old cellar—partly collapsed, the wall cracked open where the jungle had started to creep in. Vines curled over half-buried crates, but one wall caught his eye.

A **glyph**, faint and nearly worn away, pulsed once when he touched it.

> “A soul-bound marking,” Veyra murmured. “It reacts only to family blood.”

It opened a small compartment.

Inside, wrapped in dried cloth, lay a slip of parchment and low grade storage ring.

**To our son, if you return.**  
We hoped to explain everything, but time grew short.  
We are safe. We had to leave. We waited three moons.  
There is someone who can help you understand.  
Seek the city of **Aurisen**.  
Find a shop called **Thread of Echoes**.  
Ask for **Master Ren Liang**.  
He will know what to do.  
—Mother and Father
-PS 
There are some provisions and 3 superior grade protection thalismans in the ring.
Be safe.

Aran read the message three times before his hands started to shake.

They were **alive**.

They had known he might return. They had waited. They had left something behind.

Hope.

A path.

But…

> “Aurisen?” he muttered. “Where… where is that?”

---

### 🛤️ Scene – The Journey Begins

He stood at the edge of the village as the sun dipped low, casting long shadows through broken beams and creeping vines.

He didn’t know where Aurisen was. Not the direction. Not the distance.

But he had a name. A city. A thread to follow.

He looked back once more at Greenveil.

Not to say goodbye—but to promise something.

> “I’ll come back when I know enough to protect it.”

He turned. Took a step forward.

And walked away from the ashes, toward the unknown.

Not alone.

But **chosen**.
