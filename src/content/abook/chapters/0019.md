## **Chapter 19 – The Caravan Test**

The caravan was already stirring when Aran arrived at the southern gate.

Wagons creaked as their loads were secured, harnesses clinked around thick-necked draft beasts with faint spiritual bloodlines, and low chatter passed between guards tightening their belts and checking spear shafts. The scent of fresh bread, saddle oil, and crushed spirit herbs mingled with morning dew.

Aran adjusted the straps on his satchel and stepped forward.

“Name?” asked a tall woman with a scar beneath one eye. She wore leathers over iron scale, a short sword at her hip, and a scroll of permits tucked under one arm.

“Aran. I’m listed under the trader Bereth Kain.”

She flipped through the scroll, found the entry, and nodded. “General labor and support. You're light, so you’ll ride wagon four or march beside it. No wandering. No lone beast hunting. We move at sunbreak, no waiting.”

He dipped his head. “Understood.”

She handed him a thin leather armband marked with a faded caravan sigil. “Captain Yerna. Keep up, Glowroot.”

**Wagon Four** was operated by Bereth Kain, an older herbalist whose voice crackled like dry bark. He wore thick goggles over his eyes and chewed something bitter-smelling between his teeth.

“New hand, huh?” Bereth grunted. “You know your roots from your rocks?”

Aran gave him a faint smile. “Enough not to eat the wrong one.”

Bereth snorted. “We’ll see.”

The caravan moved slowly but steadily, wheels grinding over well-worn forest roads. Hills rolled like sleeping giants, and the trees thinned gradually. Dust kicked up with each turn, but the wind kept it from choking them. Spirits beasts were rare here—warded away by boundary stones and patrols—but their marks were visible to trained eyes: claw scores on bark, Qi burn in dry soil, the faint stink of musk.

Aran mapped as he went, sketching symbols and trail features into a worn notebook. He gathered loose herbs when they stopped—nothing rare, but still useful: Silverfern, Dustbud, and one stubborn Flameberry plant clinging to a slope.

At camp that night, he quietly ground a small batch of Flameberry and Barkmoss into a basic healing salve. When a guard with a twisted ankle limped past, Aran offered it without a word.

By morning, word had spread. Quiet kid. Knows his craft. Doesn’t talk much.

---

It wasn’t all quiet, though.

On the third day, a guard named **Palen** began sniffing around.

He was young, brash, and bore a copper-ranked cultivator’s pendant that swung far too visibly from his neck.

“You’re not guilded,” Palen said, leaning on a wagon beside Aran. “No badge. No beltmark. Just a dirty satchel.”

Aran looked up from the herb bundles he was wrapping. “I’m not here to impress anyone.”

Palen sneered. “You’re not even supposed to be selling. You’re nothing but a clever forager.”

Bereth, nearby, cleared his throat. “He’s also the one who kept your supplies from molding last night. That crate was rotting until he spotted it.”

Palen flushed but didn’t reply.

---

The fourth night was different.

The wind changed at dusk—sharp, dry, and tinged with copper.

Aran noticed it first. A low growl that didn’t belong. Faint tremors in the ground near the edge of camp.

Then came the cry.

A sentry’s whistle cut through the air—once, twice, three times. Urgent.

The caravan snapped into motion. Guards drew weapons. Merchants ducked behind wagons. Talismans were activated, forming flickering wards around the camp's perimeter.

Then it burst through the southern hedge—a beast of blackened scales, hunched limbs, and jagged tusks.

**Steelhide Ravager.**

Not large, but fast. Agile. Too fast.

Palen lunged to intercept but was batted aside like a rag.

The beast charged toward wagon four.

Bereth froze.

Aran didn’t.

He dove between the beast and the wagon, unrolling a talisman midair—**Glowflare**.

Light exploded in a searing flash. The Ravager reeled, disoriented.

Aran dashed left, drawing its gaze away from the camp.

> Come on. Just a little farther…

He led it past a pile of broken crates and dropped a second talisman—a **repurposed ruin sigil**: a burst glyph meant for concussive force.

When the beast lunged, it triggered the trap.

Boom.

A shockwave slammed it sideways, breaking its rhythm. Its flank bled where metal-hard scales cracked.

Aran gritted his teeth, rolled to avoid its tail, and struck it once with his dagger, channeling a pulse of raw Qi.

The beast shuddered.

Then stumbled.

Then fell.

---

Aran collapsed beside it, panting, arms shaking.

He didn’t hear the cheers right away.

Didn’t see Captain Yerna approach with narrowed eyes and folded arms.

“You baited it,” she said flatly.

“I didn’t have time to think of anything else.”

“Smart. Dangerous. Useful.”

She tossed him a water flask.

Then, after a pause: “Where’d you learn to fight like that?”

Aran stared at the flickering campfire.

“Somewhere with no second chances.”

Yerna studied him for a moment longer, then nodded.

“Report to me in the morning. I’ve got something better than salve work for you.”

---

Palen, bruised and silent, offered Aran a wrapped cloth the next morning.

“Shield stone,” he said, not quite meeting Aran’s eyes. “You earned it.”

Aran accepted it with a nod.

Bereth chuckled. “Glowflash. That’s what they’re calling you now.”

Aran rolled his eyes but didn’t argue.

---

The caravan moved on.

Farrowshade lay ahead, days away.

But the road behind had taught him something vital:

> In a world full of titles, papers, and power plays… there was still room for someone who simply **acted**.
