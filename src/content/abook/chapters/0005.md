## **Chapter 5 – Silent Hunt** 

The ruins were no longer silent.

Not truly.

As Aran crept deeper into the labyrinthine halls, the stillness around him began to unravel. It wasn’t noise he heard—but sensation. Whispers through the walls, energy humming faintly in the veins of the ruin itself. The deeper he went, the more the air felt… aware. Like something vast and unseen had just turned its attention his way.

The ancient stone corridor ahead had cracked and shifted with time, warped by roots that had burst through the walls like claws. Strange vines slithered across the ceiling, bioluminescent moss shedding a pale green glow that painted Aran’s face in ghost-light. The air was damp, thick with the scent of old metal and plant life.

Aran crouched low behind a broken statue—half-buried in vines and forgotten carvings. His heart pounded as he pressed one hand to the stone and exhaled slowly through his nose, steadying himself.

He wasn’t alone.

Movement.

Just beyond the collapsed archway, something padded into view—a shadow given form. It stepped with grace and tension, like a predator honed by years of survival. Its shoulders rippled with lean muscle, and its eyes glowed faintly with mana-blue light, scanning the air instead of the floor.

The beast was long and sinewy, a feline predator with ridged scales where fur should be. Its nostrils flared.

It wasn’t hunting by sight.

**It was tracking Qi.**

Aran stilled completely, trying to remember everything he’d seen during the Soul Artifact’s instructional echoes. This beast wasn’t some common animal—it had a **cultivated core**. It could process Qi, sense it, and react.

> “Mana signature: Tier 1 beast. Class: Predator. Affinity: Wind. Recommended response: evade,” Veyra whispered directly into his mind.

Aran’s throat tightened.

“Right. Easy,” he breathed under his breath. “Just evade the wind-powered jungle panther that can smell my life force.”

> “Stealth suppression recommended. Veil Ring activation advised. Initiating passive dampening sequence…”

He didn’t hesitate.

Aran reached inward and triggered the Veil Ring’s ability.

Immediately, he felt the world shift. The ring's power settled over him like cold mist—his heartbeat slowed, the tension in his limbs bled away, and the warmth of his Qi was drawn inward, muffled.

It was like stepping into a shadow that didn’t belong to any wall.

The beast paused, ears twitching. Its gaze flicked toward Aran’s hiding place, then swept away. It padded in slow, methodical circles. Aran didn’t dare breathe too loudly. His skin crawled with gooseflesh, sweat drying too fast on his brow.

For thirty agonizing seconds, the creature sniffed at the air.

And then, just like that—it turned.

Silent. Unhurried.

And vanished into the corridor beyond.

Aran didn’t move for a full minute.

Only when the soft sound of its footsteps had fully faded did he deactivate the ring. The shadow-mist peeled away like vapor in the sun, and the sudden return of sensation—heat, sweat, racing pulse—hit him like a slap.

He slumped against the base of the statue, exhaling a breath he didn’t realize he’d been holding.

> “You maintained a calm aura under strain,” Veyra said. “A rare trait. Your control is improving.”

He chuckled dryly. “That’s one way of saying I didn’t soil myself.”

But even as he joked, he was aware of something else—**he had done it**. He’d hidden his presence from a predator. Survived not through strength, but by strategy, timing, and the artifact he now possessed.

And for the first time, he felt like he belonged in this place.

He rose, joints aching, and made his way deeper into the ruin.

The air shifted again.

Not with movement, but with **life**.

Ahead, the corridor widened into a side chamber—a shallow basin of half-collapsed stone and soil overgrown with moss, vines, and fungi. Thick roots hung from the broken ceiling like a natural curtain, and the air was warmer here, tinged with a soft, earthy aroma.

Aran’s breath caught as he stepped through.

**It was a hidden garden.**

Wild. Untouched. A spill of green in a sea of gray.

Among the chaos of overgrowth, something shimmered.

Nestled beneath a slab of crumbled wall, just barely visible between curling vines, was a small plant—its leaves wide, edged in faint silver veins. The stem glowed subtly with a greenish inner light, its Qi aura gentle but unmistakable.

A **spirit herb.**

Aran crouched low, eyes scanning the ground around it. His instincts told him this wasn’t a free gift. Danger had a way of nesting near treasures.

He brushed away some leaves, and sure enough—a **trip-root**.

A symbiotic defense plant. He remembered it from one of the illusionary lessons in the inheritance chamber. If disturbed the wrong way, it would snap and release hallucinogenic spores that could knock out a cultivator long enough to get them killed by a passing beast.

He moved carefully, circling to the side.

Found the root’s anchor line. Slid his dagger—fashioned from a beast claw—beneath it and gently lifted the vine off the soil. When it flexed, he held his breath… but it didn’t snap.

Success.

He reached forward and plucked the herb with care, severing its root base with a clean cut.

The moment it left the soil, a faint pulse of warmth spread through his fingers. It was like the plant exhaled in relief.

He smiled and tucked it carefully into a spare pouch made from woven grass fibers.

“First one,” he murmured.

> “Species: Silveredge Willowleaf. Grade: Common. Qi yield: Low. Primary uses: Blood coagulation, mild toxin resistance, base for tier-1 healing tonics,” Veyra intoned.

Aran blinked. “You can scan herbs too?”

> “Your spiritual sensitivity has reached the minimum threshold. I can assist in early identification. Manual classification library initialized.”

He looked up at the other side of the chamber.

There were more.

Six—no, seven—distinct glowing shapes among the foliage. Each one different. Some with long vines. Some with petals that pulsed softly. One grew from the side of the wall like a blooming fungus.

Aran’s grin widened.

Not only had he avoided a beast’s detection, but now he had found a living library of ingredients. This wasn’t just luck.

**It was a foothold. A beginning.**

> “Looks like we’re not just surviving anymore,” he whispered.

> “Confirmed,” Veyra replied. “Recommendation: harvest remaining viable herbs. Several will synergize into a rudimentary healing decoction.”

Aran rolled his shoulders, stepping lightly between patches of moss and root clusters.

The air smelled of potential.

Far above him, past layers of crumbling stone and root-choked hallways, the ruins shifted once more.

A faint vibration moved through the walls.

And somewhere not far off… something answered.
