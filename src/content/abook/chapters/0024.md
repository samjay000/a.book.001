## **Chapter 24 – Three Markets, One Truth**

The Farrowshade Alchemy District was a world unto itself.

It sprawled over three terraced levels of the city, each tier reflecting a different face of the same discipline. From the street-side hawkers in the lower ring to the polished guild vendors on the promenade, everything glittered with promise—and threatened with cost.

Aran stood at the edge of a stone causeway, watching the movement of buyers and sellers with the same intensity he’d used to track beasts in the jungle. His senses, sharpened by the ruins, told him what the average citizen missed: most of what gleamed here was **bait**.

The real skill wasn’t brewing.

It was **knowing what not to touch.**

---

### **I. The Outer Market – Streets and Scams**

The **Outer Bazaar** was loud and unregulated. Tents leaned against pillars. Crates overflowed with dried leaves, ground powders, and sealed glass flasks. Every merchant shouted, every shopper bartered, and the air stank of old mint, burning root, and desperation.

“Fresh Mistfern! Harvested before the third moon!”

“Stormpetal essence! Only slightly diluted!”

Aran paused at one stand where a young boy offered “Wild Flamegrass” bundled in rush cord. He picked one up, sniffed it.

Too dry. Heat signature weak.

“Where was this gathered?” he asked.

The boy hesitated. “Uh… Eastern ridge path. Near the upper basin.”

Aran turned the bundle in his fingers. “Eastern ridge has no Flamegrass. Soil’s too alkaline.”

The boy swallowed, looked away.

He put the bundle down without another word and walked on.

He saw **fake guild stamps**, **overpriced salvaged tools**, and one potion bubbling slightly in its sealed bottle—**unstable**.

By the end of an hour, he’d bought nothing.

### **II. The Middle Market – Clean, Controlled, and Coiled**

The **middle tier** was calmer, cleaner, and far more dangerous.

Here, vendors wore **official alchemy robes**, and every stall bore **guild-verified pricing scrolls**. Shoppers browsed quietly, their fingers dusted with talc to test powder purity. Spirit wards hummed faintly to deter theft.

Aran tested a few reagents—Stormbud, Silvernight root, Cloudglass resin. Good quality. Marked correctly.

But then he spotted a bundle of **Sunleaf** packed over-ripened—its scent masked by a layer of cinnamon oil. Technically not illegal. But deceitful.

> “They won’t steal from you,” he thought grimly, “but they’ll smile while you waste coin.”

Still, he needed supplies.

He bought:
- **A polished stone brewing bowl** with Qi-infusion veins  
- A **basic alchemical glove set**, reinforced at the fingers  
- Small bags of **catalyst roots**, **preservative bark**, and one sealed vial of **neutral spirit ink**

No more. No less.

He turned away from the glittering stalls and fake friendliness without looking back.

### **III. The Hidden Market – The One That Watches**

He almost missed it.

It was an old woman at a tea stall, sitting beside a worn alley arch, who whispered as he passed.

> “You walk too sharp for a surface buyer. Try the veil stall. North alley. Three flags down. Ask for Raku.”

Aran paused just long enough to nod, then followed her direction.

The **north alley** looked empty at first—just a narrow path between tall herbal towers and closed storerooms. But then he saw it: a shimmer in the air, like heat over stone. A displacement illusion.

He stepped through.

The **hidden stall** was small. No signs. No banners. Just herbs hanging in sealed arrays, and a man sitting cross-legged behind a counter, reading a worn scroll.

Raku was old, lean, and bare-footed, wearing a faded robe. His beard was short but braided, threaded with dry leaves.

“You’re not here by accident,” he said without looking up. “What do you want?”

“Herbs,” Aran said plainly. “Accurate ones.”

“Then earn them.” The man raised his head, eyes sharp. “What’s the error in using boiled Mistleaf with Flamegrass?”

Aran didn’t flinch. “Mistleaf will dilute flame resonance. Makes the tonic sluggish. Needs dry crush or it turns to sludge.”

Raku smiled faintly.

“What’s the burn point of Hollowroot oil under mid-grade spirit flame?”

“Just below 82 degrees. It bubbles at 79. You feel it three seconds before it goes bitter.”

Raku nodded, stood, and turned to a sealed cabinet. He unlocked it with a gesture.

“You’ll do.”

He laid out:
- A **bundle of fresh Ironstem**—stable, high-density Qi  
- A packet of **dehydrated Tanglevine resin**—rare, hard to store  
- One **Spirit Orchard blossom**, sealed in crystal

> “Use this in your exam,” Raku said. “Don’t waste it.”

The price was **less than half** what he’d seen above.

“Why?” Aran asked, frowning.

Raku shrugged. “Three markets sell the same herb. One lies. One shines. One teaches. Most people never find the third.”

Aran bowed slightly. “Thank you.”

“Come back if you pass.”

### **IV. The Alchemist’s Order**

That night, Aran returned to his room and laid everything out on the desk. Clean cloth. Labeled packets. His notebook beside a flickering glyph lantern.

He sorted herbs by:
- **Elemental alignment**  
- **Decay rate**  
- **Spirit signature**  
- **Infusion compatibility**

Then he made a schedule:
- Day 1–2: **Stabilization drills and basic blends**  
- Day 3: **Tonic infusion and Qi control techniques**  
- Day 4–5: **Simulated exam brews and theory review**  
- Day 6: **Mental clarity, rest, minor detox blend**

By the end of the night, he had a plan.

And the tools to match it.

---

He closed his notebook and looked out the window toward the city, still pulsing with sigil light and motion.

> “This place rewards the ones who see clearly. Not just those who burn bright.”

> “Let’s see who I become.”
