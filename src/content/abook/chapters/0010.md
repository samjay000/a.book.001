## **Chapter 10 – Clash Beneath the Crystal Tree**

The ruin’s silence had changed.

It no longer whispered with age or mystery. It **throbbed**, like the heartbeat of something vast, pulsing from deep beneath the earth.

Aran moved cautiously through a narrow canyon-like fracture in the stone, where old pathways had collapsed and time had taken root. Vines choked the crumbling walls. Cracks above let shafts of pale light filter through the dust-choked air, falling like ghostly pillars over broken statues and shattered glyphs.

Every step forward made his breath shorter.

> “Spiritual density increasing rapidly,” Veyra murmured in his mind. “Caution. This level of ambient Qi is unsustainable for low-tier cultivators.”

“I noticed,” Aran whispered.

Even his **bones felt heavier**, like the very air resisted him. It wasn’t just Qi pressure—it was intent. The kind of pressure left by beings **used to killing**.

He scaled a crooked stone slab and hauled himself onto a ridge of cracked flooring. What he saw beyond froze him in place.

---

**A basin.**

A natural bowl formed by collapsed ceilings and overgrown roots. At its center stood a **tree made of crystal**.

Its branches reached toward the open fracture in the ceiling above, where a faint shaft of real daylight poured in. The tree pulsed softly—bluish-white, like moonlight wrapped in water. Its bark was translucent, its roots dug deep into the stone, and at the base…

A **single flower** bloomed.

Violet. Four-petaled. Glowing with life so condensed it was almost blinding.

Even from here, Aran could feel its energy reaching into the soil.

> “That is no ordinary herb,” Veyra whispered. “Uncatalogued. Estimated classification: Rare Tier – Growth and Essence Affinity. A perfect cultivation catalyst… or bait.”

“Bait?” Aran frowned.

Then he heard it.

The hiss of stone under pressure. The low growl of thunder without rain.

---

**They arrived within seconds of each other.**

From the far side of the basin, something slithered out of the water with bone-scraping grace. **A serpent**, long and thick as a tree trunk, its scales black with emerald veins glowing faintly. It moved like smoke through water—liquid and silent.

**The Venomback Serpent.**

Its eyes locked on the herb. It coiled once, possessively.

Then the wind shifted.

From above, a massive shadow dropped from a shattered ledge—slamming into the basin floor like a meteor. The ground quaked.

It stood.

Tall. Broad. Covered in thick fur that crackled with residual lightning. In one hand, it held a blunt stone club—wrapped in bark and vines, as if it had shaped it itself.

**The Thunderhide Ape.**

It bared its teeth and let out a roar that **rattled the stones** around the basin.

The serpent didn’t flinch.

Neither did Aran.

He couldn’t. His body refused to move. Every instinct screamed for him to run, but something deeper held him still.

Awe.

Fear.

Respect.

> “These aren’t beasts,” he whispered. “They’re cultivators.”

---

**The clash began without warning.**

The serpent struck like a whip, fangs flashing. Venom sprayed from its mouth, melting stone where it landed. The ape dodged left, rolled forward with shocking speed, and brought its club down in a hammering arc.

**Lightning exploded** from the impact, rippling through the air like a shockwave.

Aran flattened himself to the ridge as dust and Qi flared upward.

They fought like titans.

The serpent wrapped around the ape’s arm, trying to crush and poison it. The ape responded with a headbutt that discharged a wave of thunder, forcing the serpent to uncoil and hiss in agony.

It wasn’t just strength—it was skill. They read each other, adapted, countered.

Aran **watched everything**.

He studied the way the serpent coiled its power before striking. How it flowed its Qi through its spine to enhance reflexes. How the ape drew energy through its limbs and redirected it like an internal circuit—**lightning body cultivation**.

> “They fight like martial masters,” he murmured. “But they’re monsters.”

> “Incorrect,” Veyra said. “They are mana beasts of the fourth stage. Equivalent to peak Mortal Awakening. With proper guidance, either could ascend.”

That made Aran swallow hard.

He wasn’t even sure he’d survive a single blow from either one.

---

**Then the end came.**

The serpent struck too low—aiming for the ape’s thigh.

The Thunderhide grabbed its neck and lifted it skyward. His body **crackled** as lightning surged through his muscles. He slammed the serpent into the ground once. Twice.

On the third slam, its skull caved in.

But the victory came at a cost.

The serpent’s fangs had pierced the ape’s side. Venom poured into its bloodstream. The ape staggered, club falling from its hand.

It turned toward the herb, dragging itself across the stone, blood and poison leaking from every limb.

One massive arm reached for the flower…

And fell.

Dead.

---

Silence.

No birds. No wind. Just stillness and the crackle of fading Qi.

Aran remained frozen for a full minute.

Only when the spiritual pressure began to lessen did he move.

He made his way down from the ridge with care, every step measured. He passed the Thunderhide Ape, now cold. Its body still radiated residual power.

He bowed once.

Then approached the flower.

The **Crystalfade Bloom**.

> “It’s safe now,” Veyra said. “But do not consume it. Not yet. It must be preserved.”

Aran knelt and gently extracted it, keeping root and soil intact. He placed it within the spirit soil patch he’d been cultivating inside the **World Ring**.

As he turned to leave, he hesitated.

The beasts’ bodies were already fading—cores shattered by death or overloaded. But some materials remained.

He carefully harvested:
- A vial of **Venomback’s fang poison**
- Tufts of **Thunderhide fur**—crackling with latent lightning
- Two **bone fragments**, still humming with elemental Qi

He took them all.

Not as trophies.

But as **lessons**.

---

As he climbed from the basin, he looked back once.

The tree still stood, silent and beautiful.

Then, as if sensing his departure, it dimmed. Its light faded into the soil, becoming part of the earth again.

> “They fought for power,” he whispered. “And died for it.”

He clenched his fists.

> “I’ll grow strong too. But not like them.”

He turned his back to the battlefield, the herb secured, the memory seared into his bones.

Not all strength was earned by violence.

But sometimes, power only came **after** surviving it.
