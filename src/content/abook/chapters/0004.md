## **Chapter 4 – The Artifact Vault** *(Rewritten)*

The moment Aran stepped onto the rune-lit path, the corridor behind him sealed shut.

A hum resonated beneath his feet—not sound exactly, but vibration, like the deep stirring of slumbering stone. Every step forward brought more silence. Not the peaceful kind, but a stillness that watched.

He passed walls marked with age—runes faded, partially broken, yet pulsing faintly as if recognizing him. The Soul Artifact, that constant presence in the back of his mind, said nothing. It watched, like the chamber did.

Eventually, the path widened. And then… opened.

The Vault revealed itself like the bowing of a curtain.

Aran stepped into a circular stone hall, massive and echoing. Twelve pedestals stood in a ring formation, each holding a different object suspended in mid-air. The room was deathly quiet, yet his heart thudded as if he were standing before a gathering of silent watchers.

Weapons. Trinkets. Oddities.

A jagged **blade** wreathed in faint flame.  
A **stone orb** with cloudlike Qi drifting within.  
A **black scroll**, sealed with a dragon-headed clasp.  
A **jade flute**, humming in tune with unseen music.

And near the back, almost hidden behind the others—an **unassuming silver ring**, floating low and completely still.

The Soul Artifact finally spoke.

> “Artifact Vault recognized. This is a selection chamber. Choose an external legacy item. The Soul Artifact cannot assist in this process.”

Aran blinked. “Wait. So… you’re not one of these?”

> “Correct. I am soul-bound. Interface remains dormant until sufficient soul strength is attained.”

That explained the absence he’d felt—why the voice had presence, but not weight. The Artifact was bound *within*, beyond his reach. These were tools—external legacies. And one of them was meant for him.

Cautiously, he approached.

Each artifact pulsed faintly as he neared—testing him.  
Some pushed him away: the flaming blade grew too hot; the orb trembled violently; the scroll buzzed in his skull, whispering in forgotten tongues.  
Only the silver ring stayed still. Calm. It didn’t beckon, didn’t push. It simply waited.

His fingers reached out—and the moment he touched it, a soft pulse passed through his skin. Not painful. Not powerful. Just… present.

A wave of warmth spread through his hand and into his core.

> “Dimensional resonance confirmed. Spatial-tier artifact bound.”

The ring gently slipped onto his finger.

Aran staggered slightly as the interface flared—this one separate from his Soul Artifact. A soft impression entered his mind—not a voice, but an understanding. The ring wasn’t alive, but it had memory. Design. Purpose.

And it accepted him.

A ripple of Qi shifted around him as the bonding finalized. Runes lit around the room once more. He could feel it—*a world*, folded in space, now linked to his core.

He closed his eyes… and in a heartbeat, he **sensed the interior of the ring**. Empty, for now. A flat terrain of untouched stone and soft soil. Still air. A waiting grove. A seed of a world.

> “You have acquired a World Ring,” the Soul Artifact noted, its voice distant, analytical. “You may now begin cultivating auxiliary knowledge: spirit herb care, array planting, alchemy preparation, and spatial storage.”

Aran’s thoughts turned quickly—**this changed everything**. Not only could he carry more—but if what the artifact implied was true, he could *grow* within it. Spirit herbs. Alchemy ingredients. Maybe even formations.

This wasn’t just a tool. It was a future.


Just as the glowing runes began to fade and the path ahead lit once more, something caught Aran’s eye—**a flicker in the corner of the chamber**, near a cracked pedestal that didn’t pulse like the others.

It wasn’t lit. Wasn’t hovering.

Yet there, resting in the dust, lay another **ring**.

This one was thin, shadow-black with faint etchings that shimmered only when he looked at them from the corner of his eye. Where the World Ring pulsed gently with life and growth, this one felt… cold. Hidden. Waiting.

The Soul Artifact stirred again.

> “Residual energy signature detected. Artifact: Incomplete Record – Veil Ring.”

Aran knelt, examining it cautiously. Unlike the others, it offered **no pressure**. No presence at all. In fact, if he turned his head slightly, it disappeared entirely from sight.

He reached out and touched it.

There was no resistance.

Just a faint shift in the air—and then the ring slipped onto the **middle finger of his left hand**, tightening slightly, then vanishing from view entirely, blending with his skin tone.

A new notification flickered in his vision.

A shiver ran down Aran’s spine. He could feel it working already—**his presence growing dim**, his breath almost nonexistent to spiritual senses.

This was a different kind of tool.

Not one for growing power… but **hiding it**.

The Soul Artifact spoke again, its tone almost impressed.

> “Dual-artifact resonance achieved. Candidate survival probability increased significantly.”

Aran stood tall.

One ring to build a future.

One ring to **hide it**.

He turned toward the open corridor, both rings glowing faintly, each a promise.
