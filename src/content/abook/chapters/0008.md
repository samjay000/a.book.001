## **Chapter 8 – The Forgotten Flame**

Aran’s body ached with every step.

The battle with the Mistclaw Lurker had left him bruised, slashed, and spiritually drained. Even with the herbs he had applied, the pain lingered in his ribs, wrapping around his chest like an old bruise refusing to fade.

But he kept moving.

The tunnel that led beyond the aqueduct curved sharply downward, stone worn smooth by time and moisture. Strange runes pulsed faintly along the walls—not warding glyphs, but **guidance runes**, the kind used in legacy trial paths.

> “These were designed to lead candidates to profession chambers,” Veyra noted, her tone thoughtful.  
> “This section of the ruins was once used for auxiliary cultivation—alchemy, refinement, formation theory. Few candidates passed this way.”

“Guess I’m one of the lucky few,” Aran muttered, limping forward.

The passage widened into a cavern that shimmered with residual heat.

Broken stone benches lined the perimeter. Soot-stained walls bore scorch marks and faded alchemical diagrams. Clay jars sat overturned, their contents long dried to dust. At the center of the room, nestled in a stone pedestal, sat a **blackened forge**—shaped like a lotus in bloom.

In front of it stood an **empty cauldron**. Cracked. Scorched. Waiting.

Aran stepped into the chamber, and the forge pulsed once—runes along the walls flaring to life.

A voice whispered.

Not mechanical. Not spiritual.

**Memory.**

> “Welcome, Initiate of Flame. You stand in the Hall of the Forgotten Root.”

A projection coalesced before him—**a middle-aged woman in robes of dark gold**, her sleeves dusted with ash.

> “Here, alchemists learned not only to refine pills and potions—but to understand fire. Not all flames are born of wood and spark. The greatest flames are born of will. Of Qi.”

The image turned, gesturing toward the cauldron.

> “Sit. Learn. The flame remembers.”

### 🔥 Scene – Elemental Flame & Qi Ignition

Aran did as instructed, seating himself cross-legged in front of the cauldron. The chamber warmed slightly as glyphs etched along the forge began to glow.

> “True alchemy begins not with herbs, but with **intention**,” the echo said.  
> “You must first summon flame—not from wood, but from within.”

A formation flared beneath him. Veyra chimed in.

> “This is a controlled ignition circle. It will assist in shaping your first spiritual flame. Focus your Qi along your lower dantian and direct it through the palm.”

Aran took a breath. Closed his eyes.

He visualized the flow—**a spiral of warmth** gathering at his core, coiling upward through his chest and arm. At first, it resisted. Then, like a held breath, it released.

His palm shimmered.

A spark.

Then, a flicker of pale flame danced across his fingers—faint, but real.

It hovered, alive.

> “Ignition achieved,” Veyra confirmed. “Beginner-tier alchemist flame: Stable but low heat.”

The projection nodded approvingly.

> “Feed the flame. Fuel it not with rage or hunger, but clarity. Focus, and the flame will obey.”

### 🌿 Scene – Crude Crafting: First Salve Attempt

Aran scanned the chamber. In one corner sat a **shelf of sealed clay canisters**—some still intact. He cracked one open and found **old herbs preserved with wax and Qi**. Faded labels etched in ancient script lined the jars. Others held dried roots and glowing seeds.

He retrieved a few familiar ingredients from his own pouch:

- **Silveredge Willowleaf** (coagulant)  
- **Ashroot Bud** (draws out infection)  
- **Needle Fern pulp** (stamina booster)  
- A drop of **Glowcap extract** (binder)

He crushed the leaves with a stone pestle, mixing them in a cracked bowl, then hovered his palm-flame over the mixture, following Veyra’s temperature cues.

> “Hold the heat steady. Don’t overcook the base.”

The mixture bubbled. Thickened. Released a faint herbal steam.

After several long minutes of careful adjustments, it cooled.

He dipped a finger in and applied it to the cut across his arm.

It stung—sharp and fast—but the pain dulled almost instantly. Warmth spread under his skin. The bleeding slowed. His muscles loosened.

It worked.

> **[ Crude Healing Salve – Tier 0 Created ]**  
> + Stops minor bleeding  
> + Soothes bruises and torn muscle  
> + Shelf Life: 2 days  
> + Side Effect: Bitter aftertaste if consumed orally (not recommended)

Aran grinned. It wasn’t pretty. But it was **his**.

### 💭 Scene – Reflection and Path Forward

As the chamber dimmed, the projection flickered.

> “To refine is to rise. The first flame is the first step. The road will scorch you. Burn bright, or fade.”

Then the image vanished.

Aran sat in silence, staring at the dying embers in the lotus forge.

> “Not a bad first attempt,” Veyra said.  
> “Shall I add ‘Apprentice Alchemist’ to your developing skill set?”

He laughed softly. “Might as well. I’ve already got the singed eyebrows to prove it.”

He stored the remaining herbs, then used the salve on his ribs. The pain finally began to dull into a manageable throb. His breath came easier.

As he rose to leave, a faint green flicker passed outside the doorway.

Another beast? A shadow? Or just another test?

Whatever it was, he’d be ready.

He had fire now.

And fire never forgot.
