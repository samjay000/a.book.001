## **Chapter 20 – Rain on the Trail**

The storm came suddenly.

One moment the sky was cloudy but quiet; the next, a deep, rolling growl echoed across the canopy, and cold wind whipped down the caravan line. Leaves fluttered and snapped. Then came the first drop—fat, loud, splattering against canvas and armor alike.

Then another. Then dozens.

Then it became a wall of water.

“Stormfront!” Captain Yerna shouted from her lead mount. “Halt and shelter!”

The wagons groaned to a stop. Drivers scrambled to throw tarps over cargo while guards dismounted, grabbing tools and dragging ropes between trees. Even the beasts—spirit-blooded and strong—stomped uneasily as the rain intensified, their hides shivering under the downpour.

Aran pulled his hood tighter, securing the strap beneath his chin. His clothing soaked through almost immediately, but he didn’t flinch.

Rain was familiar.

Rain meant survival.

**Scene: Makeshift Camp**

The caravan erected what shelter they could—tattered canvas, Spiritthread tarps, and bone-pinned stakes hammered deep into the muddy earth. Water pooled between wagons, forming shallow streams. Several carts listed sideways where their wheels sank into soft, saturated ground.

Aran moved without prompting, climbing onto a buckled cart and beginning to reroute the canvas to reduce drag. He used talisman patches—damp-resistant types etched onto silken paper—to seal flaps and redirect water flow.

Nearby, a guard named Bren stumbled while carrying a crate and slipped into a shallow ditch. His cry echoed above the rain.

Aran was already moving.

He reached the guard in seconds, pulling him out with careful leverage. Bren’s leg was bleeding—a long gash across the thigh, already turning red from mud exposure.

“Lie down,” Aran said, kneeling. “Keep your foot straight.”

With practiced ease, he uncorked a gourd from his satchel, drew out a poultice of Barkmoss and Mistleaf, and began packing it into the wound.

“You’re not squeamish, are you?” Aran asked, his voice calm even as the storm howled.

“Not until now,” Bren grunted.

**Scene: Evening Stillness**

By nightfall, the rain hadn’t stopped, but the worst of the wind had passed. Fires sputtered under enchanted shells, barely strong enough to warm hands. The forest steamed like a wet furnace.

Inside a large tarp lean-to, Aran brewed a calming herbal drink—**Flamegrass, Dryclover, and Streamroot**—to share among the wet and weary. The scent cut through the damp air like warm smoke and honeyed bark.

Travelers gathered around him—not out of admiration, but gratitude.

One merchant muttered, “Couldn’t have asked for a better storm-brewer.”

Another asked about the blend. Aran showed them the leaves and explained how the combination strengthened heat in the stomach and chased off chills.

He didn’t boast.

He didn’t posture.

He simply shared.

And the others remembered that.

**Scene: Small Bonds**

Someone handed him a spare cloak. Another offered a strip of dried meat. Quiet thanks passed in gestures more than words.

“You don’t talk much, do you?” one of the younger guards asked.

“Don’t need to,” Aran said, shrugging. “Most folks talk enough for three.”

The group laughed, tension easing at last.

He spent the rest of the evening checking herbs, redrawing damaged talismans, and silently watching the rain fall.

**Scene: A Watchful Eye**

Captain Yerna circled the camp late into the night, cloak dragging through the mud. When she passed by Aran, he was still awake, standing on a wagon with rope in hand, adjusting a water catch.

“You weren’t asked to do that,” she said.

“No one else had the right glyph ink,” Aran replied. “Mine’s storm-stable.”

She nodded, watching the efficient patching.

“You never take credit.”

“I’ve never needed it.”

Yerna considered that, then unbuckled a leather roll from her belt and tossed it to him.

“Toolkit. Spirit-sealed. And a roll of guild-grade talisman paper.”

Aran blinked, then looked up at her. “Why?”

“Because you’re the kind of person who doesn’t ask for things. But earns them anyway.”

**Scene: After the Storm**

By morning, the rain had slowed to a misty drizzle. Shafts of gold light pierced the canopy. The forest glittered—every leaf a mirror, every stone a silver coin.

The caravan emerged from their shelters, soaked but intact.

Wagons were pushed back onto drier earth. Guards cleaned blades and checked beasts. Merchants dried bundles by fire. Morale was bruised, but not broken.

Aran stood quietly near the front, adjusting the strap on his satchel.

He didn’t say much. He never did.

But more than one pair of eyes glanced his way when the caravan began to move again.

He wasn’t in charge.

But he was steady.

And that was enough.
