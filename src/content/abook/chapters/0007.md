## **Chapter 7 – First Clash**

The ruin grew colder the deeper Aran went.

He moved through a long, broken aqueduct passage—walls crumbling, thick moss trailing across the ceiling like veins. Water trickled along shallow gutters, the air sharp with the scent of wet stone and decay.

He paused.

No insects. No sound. The very air felt **hushed**, as if the ruin were holding its breath.

> “Caution,” Veyra whispered. “Residual beast essence detected. Blood traces… fresh.”

Aran crouched low, scanning the ground.

Claw marks. Deep and recent. Four talons—sharp, deliberate. Prints trailed along the slick stones and vanished around a bend. Mist crept across the ground unnaturally thick for this level.

He tensed.

Then he saw it. A glimmer of movement above.

**Too late.**

A blur of motion dove from the shadows above the broken archway. A shape cloaked in mist and muscle, talons gleaming like wet stone. Aran threw himself to the side—just enough to avoid being skewered, but not enough to escape entirely.

Pain erupted across his ribs as the beast’s claw raked him.

He hit the ground hard, breath knocked from his lungs. His back scraped across sharp gravel, and he rolled, coughing as he scrambled for cover behind a cracked pillar.

The beast landed in a crouch. Four limbs. Lithe. **A Mistclaw Lurker**—he recognized it from the illusionary beast logs in the artifact chamber.

Its body shimmered with mist, masking its shape. It circled silently, head low, tongue flicking the air. Its eyes glowed faintly with pale green light, focused not on movement—but on **Qi**.

> “Tier One Mana Beast,” Veyra confirmed. “Affinity: Wind and Water. Misting camouflage active. Physical evasion required.”

Aran’s ribs ached. His fingers shook.

This wasn’t a training vision. This was real.

And it wanted to kill him.

He pressed a hand to his side—blood seeped through his shirt. Shallow wound, but it hurt like hell. No time to bind it.

He reached inward. Touched the cool presence of the **Veil Ring**.

A breath. A pulse.

He activated it.

Mist coiled around him—but this time, he became part of it. His Qi dropped low. Breath slowed. The ring muted his spiritual signature. Not gone—but quieted. Less prey. Less threat.

The Mistclaw sniffed. Turned its head. Snorted.

Then… it moved.

Too smart to ignore the scent of blood. Too hungry to question a little silence.

It began circling the pillar.

Aran gritted his teeth. “Not going to die here,” he whispered.

As it closed in, he flicked his hand, sending a crushed **Glowcap Fungus** into the mist. The spores burst midair in a dull flash—brief but bright.

The beast hissed, momentarily stunned by the unexpected flare.

Aran moved.

He dove from the other side, rolling across the stone, and darted into a narrow crevice near the aqueduct’s base. Blood left a trail, but the mist thickened, giving him cover.

His mind raced.

> “Options,” he muttered. “Think.”

He scanned his pouch. **Whisperleaf. Needle Fern. Ashroot Bud.**  
And his dagger—still sharp, still stained from training.

The Mistclaw padded into view, slinking low.

Aran chewed a sliver of **Whisperleaf**. His pulse slowed, clarity washing over him. The pain faded slightly. His thoughts aligned.

“Trap it,” he breathed. “Like it would trap me.”

He reached into his pouch and pulled out a coiled trip-root he’d salvaged earlier from the herb grove. Thin, springy, and reactive. He tied it between two fallen slabs, low to the ground. Then he scraped a gash in his arm and **let the blood drip**—just enough—toward the path.

He limped forward, leaving the trail. Slipped into the mist. Waited.

The beast followed. Step by silent step.

Closer.

It lunged for the blood.

And hit the trip-root.

It snapped with a sharp crack, wrapping around the beast’s front leg and yanking it sideways.

Aran moved without thinking. Charged in from the side, dagger drawn. He drove the point into the beast’s neck—just beneath the jaw. It thrashed, howled, slammed into him.

They both hit the ground.

The dagger was still embedded in the neck, but it wasn’t dead.

The Mistclaw rose, blood pouring down its shoulder. Its body flickered with mist again—half-visible, half-phantom.

Aran rolled to his feet. His own blood dripped steadily now. The beast was faster, stronger.

But he was desperate.

He activated the Veil Ring again—this time, only partially. A flicker. A ghost-step.

The beast hesitated. Couldn’t fully see him. Aran used that moment. Dashed behind it, grabbed the hilt, and **drove the dagger deeper**.

The Mistclaw screeched—and collapsed.

This time, it didn’t rise.

---

Silence.

Broken only by Aran’s ragged breathing.

He dropped to his knees, drenched in sweat and blood. His vision blurred. Pain radiated through his body like fire, but he was alive.

> “Kill confirmed,” Veyra intoned calmly. “Beast core located. Internal energy stabilized.”

Aran reached for the beast’s chest, pulled free a small, pulsing orb—faintly blue, dense with natural Qi. **His first beast core.**

He stared at it for a long moment.

Small. Warm. Glowing with life stolen from countless prey.

He dropped it into his World Ring and sat back, letting the mist around him finally settle.

He chewed more Whisperleaf, then crushed **Silveredge Willowleaf** into a paste and pressed it against the slash across his ribs. It burned. He hissed through his teeth.

> “Wound treatment effective. Suggest rest before further movement.”

> “Noted,” he grunted.

As he leaned back against the ruined wall, a soft chime echoed.

He closed his eyes, letting the interface fade.

He had fought a beast and won.

Barely.

It wasn’t skill. Not yet. It was instinct. Survival. And a little luck.

But it was enough.

> “Next time,” Aran whispered, “I won’t need luck.”
