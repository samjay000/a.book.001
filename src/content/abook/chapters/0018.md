## **Chapter 18 – Beneath the Market Tent**

The next morning, Aran arrived at Silverleaf Traders before sunrise.

The market square was still yawning itself awake—wooden stalls being raised with a chorus of creaking rope and hammered pegs, merchants barking at half-awake assistants, and the faint smell of steamed rice and spiced tea rising from roadside kitchens. Duskwatch wasn’t glamorous, but it was a city of motion—of deals struck between cracked palms and coins traded under flickering lanterns.

Maela Ryn greeted him with a nod from behind a small table where dried root bundles were already laid out for inventory.

“You’re early,” she said, not looking up from her ledger.

“You said the good herbs sell before noon,” Aran replied. “Figured I’d learn how.”

That earned him a sideways glance and the ghost of a smile. “You might actually last here.”

---

Maela put him to work immediately.

At first, it was simple: sorting through bundles brought in by traveling herb gatherers and low-tier cultivators. Aran’s job was to separate the true spirit herbs from the useless lookalikes—and to flag any signs of rot, contamination, or misalignment.

> “Flamegrass grows with the root turned east. You can tell by the curl,” Maela said, watching him examine a bundle. “If it curls west, it’s fieldburn—no use to alchemists, makes a poor base.”

He nodded, adjusting the bundle carefully.

In the first two hours, he identified **Mistleaf**, **Stoneveil pods**, and a wilted version of **Ashroot** that had to be tossed. For each herb, he added notes to a small parchment square: condition, estimated grade, storage temperature.

When she saw the notes, Maela blinked. “You’re taking this seriously.”

Aran just shrugged. “I like knowing what’s worth what.”

---

By midday, he had settled into the rhythm of the market.

He watched Maela haggle over Firethorn bark with a traveling herbalist, adjusting her tone depending on whether she was speaking with a novice trader or a seasoned caravan master. She rarely raised her voice—but somehow always got the final word.

Aran tried to learn as much from her silence as from her words.

---

In the early afternoon, the first sign of trouble arrived.

A smooth-faced man in a forest-green vest strolled up to the stall. His eyes lingered too long on the herb bundles, and his smile was just a little too sharp.

“Silverleaf’s gotten bold,” he said lightly. “Heard you’re buying from wildcrafters now.”

Maela didn’t flinch. “You heard wrong, Torrin.”

Aran paused mid-sort.

Torrin Rell.

Another merchant, from what he’d gathered. Not a friend.

Torrin leaned on the edge of the table, ignoring Aran completely. “Selling herbs without guild markings? Careful. Guild inspectors don’t always ask twice.”

“I’ve cleared everything with the watch. And none of my herbs are yours to inspect.”

Torrin’s smile widened, but his eyes turned cold. “For now.”

He walked off without another word.

---

That evening, Maela said nothing until they closed the stall.

Then, as they counted coin and checked storage, she finally spoke.

“You were ready to jump him,” she said without looking at Aran.

“I wasn’t going to start a fight,” he replied.

“But you would’ve ended one. I saw it in your hands.”

Aran lowered his eyes. “He was trying to ruin your business.”

“And I’ll handle it. Not with fists. Not yet.”

She turned to him, her gaze level. “Torrin spreads rot by whispering in ears, not stabbing backs. But all it takes is one buyer hearing ‘unlicensed goods,’ and our trade dries up.”

“What do we do?”

“We play his game better.”

---

The next day, Maela made her move.

She adjusted prices—barely, just enough to draw in Torrin’s usual early-morning customers. She slipped a rumor into the hands of a wandering courier, one who owed her a favor, about **Torrin’s poor preservation techniques**. Then she let nature run its course.

By dusk, a key buyer from the inner market had walked away from Torrin’s stall in frustration—and Maela hadn’t raised her voice once.

---

That night, Aran shared a simple stew with Maela behind the stall. They sat on overturned crates, steam rising between them.

“You’ve got good instincts,” she said between sips. “But instincts are raw. What you need now is patience.”

Aran looked into the firelight. “I’ve fought beasts. Survived trials. I’ve made it this far.”

“Civilization’s harder,” she said simply. “People are cleverer than monsters. You never know where the bite’s coming from.”

He nodded slowly. The lesson was sinking in.

---

Later, as the city quieted and torches flickered low, Aran stood near the northern gate. He watched the caravan lots where wagons were being loaded. He listened to the snorting of beasts, the hammering of crates, the low murmur of travel plans and supply checks.

A caravan would leave in four days.

Heading toward **Farrowshade**.

Toward the Alchemist Guild.

Toward answers.

He pulled out his notebook and wrote a single line beneath his market notes:

> “Four days to learn. Then we move.”

He looked toward the stars.

> “This is just the first ring. I’m not even close to the core yet.”
