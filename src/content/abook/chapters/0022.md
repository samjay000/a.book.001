## **Chapter 22 – Fangs in the Fog**

The morning mist rolled in like a living thing.

At first, it was a soft curtain of moisture clinging to boots and wagon wheels, swirling around ankles and pooling along the edges of the trail. But as the sun rose behind a thick veil of clouds, the fog deepened—white and unbroken, swallowing sound and space alike.

Even the birds fell silent.

Captain Yerna narrowed her eyes at the treeline. “This patch wasn’t on the map.”

Bereth Kain grunted from the rear wagon, pipe unlit for once. “It’s old forest. Deep-rooted. Breathes strange when the seasons change.”

Aran stood near the second wagon, his hand brushing the satchel at his hip. The fog made the world feel smaller—close enough to touch, and dangerous because of it.

His instincts buzzed.

He’d learned to trust that feeling.

---

The first sign was the crunch.

Not of twigs or leaves, but of something sharper—bone against root. Then came the low growl, barely audible, but thick with intent.

A shout rang out from the left flank. “Movement!”

Then chaos erupted.

From the mist surged **shadow wolves**—long-bodied beasts cloaked in dark fur that seemed to shimmer with the fog itself. Their eyes burned faint silver. They moved in coordinated silence, their howls swallowed by the dense air, their movements razor-precise.

One guard didn’t even have time to raise his spear before being bowled over.

Another wolf knocked over a smaller wagon, scattering crates of dried herbs and panicked cries.

Aran reacted instantly.

“Back to the core circle!” Yerna barked, slashing at a lunging wolf.

Aran didn’t move toward the center.

He moved **into the mist**.

---

His mind raced as his hands moved.

From his pouch, he drew a small vial—**Mistleaf and Rotroot oil**, combined into a pungent salve designed to interfere with scent-based trackers. He smeared a thick line across the front of his cloak, then dragged a matching line onto a nearby fallen tree trunk.

Next, he reached for paper—**talisman parchment** gifted by Yerna days earlier—and drew a quick array in chalk ink: an unstable glyph meant to overload the senses when triggered.

He wedged it beneath a slanted stone and waited.

The alpha showed itself moments later.

Bigger than the rest, with broader shoulders and a white scar across its snout. Its eyes locked onto him—aware, intelligent, furious.

Aran didn’t flinch.

He tossed a shard of fire-touched metal beside the glyph and ran.

The wolf chased, its weight barely whispering against wet leaves. Aran vaulted a fallen log, baiting it forward. Just before the beast lunged, the shard rolled onto the glyph.

**Flash. Boom.**

A shock of light and sound burst from the stone, flaring like a firework through the fog.

The wolf howled in confusion and pain, its rhythm broken.

Aran spun, dagger in hand, and slashed across its exposed flank—not deep enough to kill, but enough to bleed and stagger.

Then he was gone, vanishing back toward the caravan lines.

---

Elsewhere, **Liraen** and **Bren** were holding a narrow chokepoint near wagon six, using alchemical fire to scare back a second flank. Bereth shouted coordinates from a perch on a tipped crate, calling where the mist shifted unnaturally.

Aran arrived, panting, eyes sharp. “Their leader’s injured. They’re losing cohesion.”

Liraen blinked. “You faced the alpha?”

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he pointed. “Three more approaching from the north arc. Thin mist—less cover. Push now.”

Yerna gave the nod.

A squad surged forward, forcing the disoriented beasts into a funnel of sharpened stakes. Two wolves fell there, squealing as Qi-infused blades tore through them.

The last fled, trailing blood, into the mist.

Then silence returned.

---

The aftermath was raw.

One trader had a broken arm. A guard bore a nasty bite to the side. A wagon had lost a third of its cargo. But no one had died.

That alone felt like victory.

Yerna approached Aran as he helped Liraen gather broken talismans for recharging.

“You held the line,” she said. “And you didn’t wait to be told how.”

Aran nodded quietly. “Didn’t have time to.”

She studied him a moment longer. Then reached into her belt and handed him a **folded steel badge**. It bore the caravan sigil, but this one had a **silver edge**.

“Officers wear these. You're not one of us... but you earned it.”

Aran took it. “Thank you.”

“Keep doing what you’re doing, and you’ll survive this world longer than most.”

---

That night, the fog finally lifted.

The stars returned.

And for the first time, Aran sat a little closer to the fire. Not because he needed warmth, but because others had left space for him. Not out of obligation.

But out of respect.
