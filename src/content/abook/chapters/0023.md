## **Chapter 23 – Smoke Over Farrowshade**

The road turned to stone long before they reached the gates.

After nearly two weeks of uneven trails, muddy slopes, and fog-drenched forest passes, the sensation of clean, shaped paving underfoot felt almost foreign. The shift in texture seemed to echo something deeper—a boundary not just of land, but of life.

The trees thinned. The hills leveled. And the world beyond opened.

Farrowshade emerged at sunrise.

From the final ridge, the caravan slowed as every eye turned toward the sprawl below. Mist clung to the lower levels, casting the city in a layered haze of gold and silver. Roofs glimmered. Smoke curled from a thousand chimneys—some mundane, others alchemical. A towering gatehouse marked the city's northern entry, its walls carved with dragon-headed guardians and inlaid with shimmering runes that pulsed faintly in the dawn.

The city wasn’t simply large. It breathed.

It lived.

Tiered across the slopes of a natural valley, Farrowshade looked like it had grown from the stone itself—its districts layered like terraces carved into a mountainside. Higher levels gleamed with polished wood, flowing banners, and floating sigils. Below, the wide base teemed with industry, markets, stables, and skyship towers where spirit cranes lifted goods to upper terraces.

> “It’s not just big,” said Liraen, riding beside Aran. “It’s alive. And hungry.”

He nodded once, slowly. “And fast. You can feel it.”

Farrowshade didn’t wait for you. It moved. A pulse of commerce and cultivation. A river of ambition and control. One misstep here, and the current would carry you away.

They reached the **Outer Gate** by midday.

It loomed four stories tall, an arched structure of darkstone with veins of copper that glowed faintly. Lines of carts and caravans snaked toward it, all waiting for inspection. Along the flanks, guards in scale-stitched uniforms moved efficiently, checking permits, scanning cargo, and verifying names. Ranks of cultivators in **Alchemy Guild livery** stood along the entry path, subtly projecting their auras—just enough to warn against foolishness.

When Aran’s turn came, he stepped forward without hesitation.

“Name?” asked a female inspector, sharp-eyed and sharp-tongued.

“Aran.”

“Affiliation?”

“None.”

That word always felt heavier than it should.

She tapped a floating plate with her brush, then narrowed her eyes. “You’ve declared possession of bundled spirit herbs, tonic bases, and unstable roots. Do you hold a guild license?”

“No. I’m here to register for the Alchemy Guild Novice Exam.”

That gave her pause.

Before she could respond, Captain Yerna stepped forward.

“Silverleaf Traders. I’m vouching for this one,” she said, presenting a sealed scroll. “Worked as a field hand and salvage aide. Kept my people alive in the fog.”

The inspector examined the scroll, rubbed the wax with a small verification talisman, and finally nodded.

“Temporary city token,” she said, handing Aran a **silver-edged jade chit**. “No selling, no brewing, no unsanctioned transactions until licensed. You’ve got seven days before the permit expires. Fail your exam, and you're fined for every high-tier herb in your ring.”

“I understand,” Aran said, and stepped through.

No goodbyes. Yerna simply tilted her chin. That was enough.

**Farrowshade swallowed him whole.**

Inside the gates, everything changed.

Noise, color, movement—woven together like a thousand guilds and tradespeople trying to shout louder than each other. Floating glyph lanterns marked lanes and street types. Spirit beasts in harness pulled cargo along glowing rails. Children dashed past, trailing scent charms to avoid offending nearby cultivators.

Aran passed between high archways, stalls glowing with spellfire, and scroll-sellers hawking the latest brewing arrays. He saw apprentices—dozens of them—carrying sealed pots, alchemical flasks, and jade crates bearing volatile materials.

One misstep here and you could set a district on fire.

He watched a tense exchange between a **guild-licensed apothecary** and a ragged-looking man selling dried herbs from a crate. The man had no badge. His words were desperate, his tone pleading. But a nearby guild enforcer stepped in, grabbed the crate, and tossed it into the gutter with a glowing talisman.

> “No license, no sale,” the enforcer growled. “Come back with a mark, or don’t come back at all.”

Aran turned away.

He’d seen wolves in the jungle.

Here, they wore polished boots and used paper to kill.

He settled that night in a rented room above a quiet teahouse nestled just outside the Alchemy District proper.

It wasn’t much—four stone walls, a cot, and a flickering lantern—but it was clean, safe, and quiet. He paid for three nights in silver and asked no questions. The innkeeper, an older woman with spirit-touched eyes, gave him a respectful nod and didn’t pry.

Upstairs, Aran sat at the wooden desk and pulled out his notebook.

He took a slow breath, then struck a spark using a flicker talisman. The flame danced, casting soft shadows against the shuttered window.

He wrote:

> **Farrowshade reached.**

> **Alchemy Guild Novice Exam: 7 days.**

> **To Do:**
> - Gather equipment: brewing gloves, basic cauldron seal, reagent dishes  
> - Scout the three major herb markets (district vs. rogue vs. guild-run)  
> - Review bone marrow tonic compression principles  
> - Adjust to city Qi flow—it’s richer, but strange  
> - Find spirit lodestone infusion materials for precision work  

He stared at the list, then added:

> “The ruins taught me how to endure.  
> The road taught me how to adapt.  
> The city… will teach me who I want to become.”

Outside, smoke curled up from a dozen rooftops. Glyph lights flickered like stars in the mid-level walkways above. Somewhere beyond the skyline, the true towers of the guild stood—tall, quiet, and waiting.

> “First the jungle. Then the road. Now the gates,” Aran whispered to himself.

He closed the notebook and stood at the window, gazing at the sprawl.

> “Let’s see if I belong here.”
