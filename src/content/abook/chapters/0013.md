## **Chapter 13 – Blood and Bark**

The jungle had changed.

Or maybe he had.

Aran moved through the undergrowth in silence, each step measured, deliberate. The brush was thicker here, and the trees rose higher, their leaves forming a ceiling that let little light pass. Shafts of pale green filtered through in columns, creating an eerie cathedral of fog and foliage.

But the quiet wasn’t peace.

It was **danger**.

> “Spiritual energy fluctuating,” Veyra said softly. “Multiple presences. Stay alert.”

“I am,” Aran murmured, eyes scanning the canopy, the shadows, the tremors in the earth.

He was no longer just a boy stumbling through ruins. He had learned. Fought. Crafted.

And now he was here **on purpose**—not to escape, but to **hunt**.

### ⚔️ Scene 1 – Spiketail Daggerclaw

He felt the ambush before it struck.

A shift in wind. A wrong silence.

Then it leapt from the trees—a blur of green fur and bone. **Spiketail Daggerclaw**, its claws gleaming like hooked steel, tail arched like a scorpion’s.

Aran dove aside, landing in a shoulder roll. Dirt and leaves scattered. The beast landed hard, claws gouging bark.

He didn’t panic.

He **vanished**—activating the **Veil Ring**, blinking out of immediate sight.

The beast snarled and lunged where he had been.

Aran reappeared behind it, already pressing a **Stonebind Root Tag** onto the ground.

Roots erupted—entangling the beast’s legs mid-turn.

It thrashed—but that was all he needed.

He slapped a **Flame Pulse Sigil** onto his palm and slammed it into the Daggerclaw’s flank.

**BOOM.**

Flames surged across its side. It howled, twisting to strike, but Aran had already moved—rolling forward, and with one clean arc of his dagger, severed the beast’s throat.

It slumped.

Aran exhaled sharply.

> “Efficiency noted,” Veyra said. “One enemy down. Two more detected in vicinity.”

He nodded. One down. No injuries.

So far, so good.

### 🪴 Scene 2 – Vineshard Bloomtrap

He found it while scouting a creek bend—a **beautiful violet bloom** swaying gently under the filtered light.

His eyes widened.

> “Spirit herb,” he whispered.

Then… his **Danger Perception** trait screamed.

He froze mid-reach.

The flower snapped shut, revealing thorned vine-jaws and coiled roots that lashed toward him.

A **Vineshard Bloomtrap**—camouflaged predator plant with spiritual scent mimicry.

Aran leapt back, avoiding a spear-like root that buried itself in a stone behind him.

“Too close,” he muttered, pulling free a **Glowflare Scroll**.

The vines hissed, sensing movement.

He tossed the scroll high.

**FLASH.**

A pulse of blinding white erupted. The Bloomtrap recoiled, tendrils writhing in confusion.

He darted in, dagger ready—but the vines blocked every angle. Then he remembered the blueprint from the Forge:

> *Core in the bloom. Direct line only.*

He jumped onto a rock, sprinted up a fallen tree, launched himself mid-air—

—and tossed a **Fire rune** mid-fall.

The burning sigil struck dead center.

The core exploded in a burst of green sap and flame.

The plant shrieked—then crumpled into smoldering roots.

Aran landed, rolled, and came up with his blade raised.

But nothing moved.

Only smoke.

And beneath the carcass… **a real herb**, small and green with gold-threaded veins.

> “Mimic protected the growth beneath,” Veyra observed. “Not uncommon. Herb absorbed residual Qi.”

He added the new spirit herb to his satchel. His heartbeat slowed.

Two down.

One to go.

### 🐗 Scene 3 – Barkhide Hornbear

He felt it before he saw it.

A low rumble—earth shaking in small waves.

A tree snapped in the distance.

Then the **Barkhide Hornbear** charged through the undergrowth like a living boulder.

It was massive—shoulder-high, with curled horns like twin blades. Its hide was thick and bark-plated, and it didn’t hesitate.

Aran barely dodged as it barreled past, uprooting a bush and splintering a fallen log.

“Okay,” he breathed, “That one’s not playing.”

He tossed a **Reinforcement Seal** against his chest. Qi surged across his body like a ripple of glass.

The beast charged again.

This time, he couldn’t dodge fully—one horn clipped his side.

Pain flared, but the seal held. He tumbled, coughing but alive.

He scrambled up and ran—not away, but **toward a ravine slope** lined with moss and loose stone.

The Hornbear followed.

He set the trap fast—**Root Tag beneath a slope**, followed by a **Fire Sigil tucked in a tree stump**.

Then he stood at the edge of the path and screamed, “Come on then!”

The beast obliged.

It charged again—blind, rage-filled.

Just as it passed over the trap, the vines snapped upward, tripping it just enough for it to stumble.

Aran triggered the Fire Sigil.

**BOOM.**

The blast ignited under the beast’s stomach, where its armor was weakest.

It roared, reared, and collapsed sideways into the ditch.

Aran followed with a leap and struck—dagger finding a gap in its neck plating.

One last breath.

Then stillness.

He stood panting, soaked in sweat and beast blood.

> “Third target eliminated,” Veyra said. “Damage moderate. Stamina critical. Recommend rest.”

“Yeah,” he rasped, “I second that.”

### 🌿 Scene 4 – Recovery and Reward

He collapsed under a large leaf canopy, drank from his waterskin, and swallowed a **self-made healing elixir**. The bitter taste made his eyes water, but the warmth in his chest dulled the pain.

He opened his satchel and took stock.

- 3 **New Spirit Herbs**:  
  - **Soothing Veinleaf** (nerve repair)  
  - **Ironroot Cluster** (defensive elixir base)  
  - **Skydew Moss** (cooling, used in anti-fire tinctures)  
- Monster parts: bark-hide fragments, venom sacs, fangs, and core shards  
- Talismans used: 4 of 5  
- Injuries: Surface-level—bruised ribs, a shallow horn-slice across the shoulder

> “Effective resource acquisition,” Veyra commented. “Adaptability confirmed.”

“Still hurts,” Aran muttered.

> “Growth often does.”

### 🌄 Closing Scene – Blood and Bark

The jungle quieted as twilight fell.

Aran sat by a moss-covered ridge, watching the glow of spirit fireflies drift through the trees. His talismans were half-spent, his weapons dulled, his body sore.

But his eyes were sharp. His breath steady.

> “I can do this,” he said softly. “I’m not running anymore. Let the beasts come.”

He didn’t just walk the path now.

He **made** it.
