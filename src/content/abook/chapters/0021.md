## **Chapter 21 – Campfire and Oaths**

The storm had passed.

The last of the clouds had drifted westward, their bellies still glowing with residual lightning. In their place, stars stretched across the sky—uncounted, brilliant, and impossibly distant. The caravan moved slower now, road-slicks and fallen branches slowing progress, but spirits were rising with every dry step.

That night, Captain Yerna called a full rest.

The camp was set in a wide forest clearing beside a freshwater stream, where old boundary stones kept larger beasts at bay and the canopy above formed a soft green dome. For the first time in a week, there were no rotating sentry shifts. No growls in the dark. No storms on the horizon.

Only firelight. Laughter. And the smell of tea, charred meat, and damp earth.

Aran sat near a fire pit with a familiar group.

**Bereth Kain**, the old herbalist, gnawed on jerky and smoked spirit root as always. **Bren**, the injured guard, had his leg propped up and was finally able to laugh again. **Liraen**, a sharp-tongued alchemy apprentice with ash-brown hair and ink-stained fingers, flipped through her notebook while sipping something steaming and strong.

Captain Yerna joined late, carrying a flask of something that smelled like distilled courage and cracked spice root. She didn’t talk much—but the fact that she sat meant more than words.

“Alright,” Bereth said, tossing a twig into the flames. “Stories. Everyone’s got one. What’s the dumbest mistake you’ve made while brewing?”

Liraen groaned. “Only one? My master once made me copy a clarity tonic recipe from a memory scroll. I swapped two characters—ended up mixing Emberthorn powder into a sleep draught.”

“What happened?” Aran asked.

“She slept. And dreamed. And woke screaming in a language she didn’t speak.”

They all chuckled—even Yerna, a faint twitch at the corner of her mouth.

The stories continued, each more ridiculous than the last.

Bren tried to use a flame-based tonic to warm his boots during winter. They caught fire.

Bereth once sold twelve bundles of what he thought was Silverfern to a noble caravan, only to realize later it was actually Bitteredge—a mild hallucinogen. The noble’s pet tiger had sung for hours.

Eventually, eyes turned to Aran.

“And you?” Liraen asked. “First time you made something that didn’t kill you?”

Aran hesitated. The fire cracked softly.

“I was alone,” he said finally. “Still in the jungle. I’d been gathering herbs for weeks but hadn’t made anything with them. I got clawed up by a small beast, nothing huge—but I couldn’t stop the bleeding. I panicked. Then remembered what I'd read in an old notebook. Barkmoss and Flamegrass. Applied it wrong. Burned like fire. But it worked.”

Silence.

Then Bereth nodded. “Better burned than bled out.”

Yerna sipped from her flask but didn’t speak.

Liraen leaned closer. “Where’d you get a notebook in the wild?”

“Found it,” Aran said simply.

She stared at him for a moment, then nodded. “Fair.”

As the fire dimmed and shadows deepened, the group grew quiet.

Someone began humming a low tune. Liraen pulled her cloak tighter. Bereth tapped his pipe against his boot.

Then, as if summoned by the mood, Bereth murmured, “Old tradition. Travelers used to speak their vows before reaching a major city. Remind themselves of their path.”

“Sounds dramatic,” Liraen teased, but there was curiosity behind it.

“No one’s forcing you,” he said. “But the fire’s listening.”

Bren, rubbing his bandaged leg, went first. “I’ll make it to the eastern coast and see the ocean. Always wanted to hear the real waves.”

Bereth nodded. “I’ll retire with a garden before my beard turns white. Somewhere quiet.”

Liraen smirked. “I’ll open a shop where no one tells me to triple-check a root’s name ever again.”

Yerna, of all people, spoke softly, “Ten more years. Then I’ll train young girls to fight with spears and sharper tongues.”

All eyes turned to Aran.

He stared into the flames. His expression unreadable, as always. But then he spoke.

“I’ll find a city called Aurisen.”

The name hung in the air like the fading glow of a talisman.

Bereth blinked. “Never heard of it.”

“Neither have I,” Aran said. “Not really. But someone left it for me. And I’ll find it. Even if it takes years.”

No one laughed. No one questioned.

They simply nodded.

Later, as they lay beneath the stars, Aran stared upward, his arms behind his head. The warmth of the fire still lingered in his chest—not just the flames, but the comfort of it. The people. The shared silence.

It wasn’t home.

But for the first time in a long time, he didn’t feel alone.
