## 🧱 **I. Core Structure: Realms & Stages**

| Realm                  | Theme & Focus                                | Levels/Stages (1–9)                            |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Mortal Awakening**   | Foundation of Cultivation                    | Body tempering, Qi awakening, basic control    |
| **Transcendent Ascension** | Mastery over Self & Energy                 | Qi refinement, Soul power, elemental awakening |
| **Celestial Dominion** | Dominion over Laws & Reality                 | Law embodiment, world-shaping power            |

Each **Realm** contains **9 Stages**:

## 🔮 **II. Essence Core Paths**

Each cultivator has an **Essence Core** that determines their path:

### 🔹 **Qi Path (Energy)**
- Focuses on internal energy control, meridian cleansing, and external techniques
- Strong in ranged attacks, elemental mastery, flight, and refined technique-based combat

### 🔹 **Body Path (Tempering)**
- Focuses on physical strengthening, bone marrow refinement, durability
- Great in hand-to-hand combat, endurance, and brute force

### 🔹 **Soul Path (Spiritual)**
- Enhances mental strength, divine sense, memory, illusion resistance
- Excels in soul attacks, interface interaction, memory recall, and multi-tasking

> Cultivators can specialize or pursue **dual-path** (e.g., Qi + Body) or **triune-path** (all 3, very rare and difficult)
