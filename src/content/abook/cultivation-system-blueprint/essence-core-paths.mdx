## ðŸ”® **II. Essence Core Paths**

Each cultivator has an **Essence Core** that determines their path:

### ðŸ”¹ **Qi Path (Energy)**
- Focuses on internal energy control, meridian cleansing, and external techniques
- Strong in ranged attacks, elemental mastery, flight, and refined technique-based combat

### ðŸ”¹ **Body Path (Tempering)**
- Focuses on physical strengthening, bone marrow refinement, durability
- Great in hand-to-hand combat, endurance, and brute force

### ðŸ”¹ **Soul Path (Spiritual)**
- Enhances mental strength, divine sense, memory, illusion resistance
- Excels in soul attacks, interface interaction, memory recall, and multi-tasking

> Cultivators can specialize or pursue **dual-path** (e.g., Qi + Body) or **triune-path** (all 3, very rare and difficult)
